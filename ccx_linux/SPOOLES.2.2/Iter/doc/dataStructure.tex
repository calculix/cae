The methods in {\tt Iter} solve a linear system $AX=B$, where $A$ is an 
{\tt InpMtx} object and $X$ and $B$ are {\tt DenseMtx} objects.  
The preconditioner is a {\tt FrontMtx} object obtained via frontal method
which uses several other objects.  See header file {\tt Iter.h} for further
information.
