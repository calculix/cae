The {\tt ChvList} structure has the following fields.
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\tt Chv *head} : 
vector of pointers to the heads of the list of {\tt Chv} objects.
\item
{\tt Lock *lock} : mutual exclusion lock.
\item
{\tt int mode} : behavior mode.
When {\tt mode = 0}, the object calls {\tt SubMtx\_new()}
and {\tt SubMtx\_free()} to create and release objects.
When {\tt mode = 1}, the object recycles the objects.
\item
{\tt int nactive} : 
number of active instances.
\item
{\tt int nbytesactive} : 
number of bytes that are active.
\item
{\tt int nbytesrequested} : 
number of bytes that have been requested.
\item
{\tt int nbytesalloc} : 
number of bytes that have been allocated.
\item
{\tt int nrequests} : 
number of requests for instances.
\item
{\tt int releases} : 
number of instances that have been released.
\item
{\tt int nlocks} : 
total number of locks made on the mutual exclusion lock.
{\tt int nunlocks} : 
total number of unlocks made on the mutual exclusion lock.
\end{itemize}
