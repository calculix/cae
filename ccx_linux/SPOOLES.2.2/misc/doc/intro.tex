This directory contains a number of miscellaneous functions and
driver programs that don't really fit anywhere else.
There are functions to generate nested dissection orderings on
regular 2-D and 3-D grids --- the usual nested dissection, with
double wide separators, and local nested dissection
\cite{bha93-localND}.
There are wrapper methods for minimum degree, 
nested dissection and multisection
orderings for general graphs.
There is also a driver program to produce a postscript file for a 2-D
graph, very useful for visualizing graph partitionings and
orderings.
