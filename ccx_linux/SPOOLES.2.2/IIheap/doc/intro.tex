\chapter{{\tt IIheap}: 
% \break (Integer Key, Integer Value) Heap}
(Key, Value) Heap}
\par
The {\tt IIheap} is a object that manages a heap of data.
Both the {\it key} and the {\it value} are of type {\tt int}.
The heap has fixed size, each item must be in {\tt [0,maxsize-1]},
where {\tt maxsize} is set on initialization.
The {\tt IIheap} object requires three vectors of size {\tt maxsize}.
Three methods are supported: {\it find\_min}, {\it insert} and {\it
delete} which take $O(1)$, $O(\log_2 n)$ and $O(\log_2 n)$ time, 
respectively, where $n$ is the present size of the heap.
