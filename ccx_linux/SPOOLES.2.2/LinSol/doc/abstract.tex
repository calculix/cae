The {\bf SPOOLES} library stands for
{\bf SP}arse {\bf O}bject {\bf O}riented {\bf L}inear 
{\bf E}quation {\bf S}olver.
It is written in the C language using object oriented design
and can solve real or complex linear systems in serial,
multithreaded and MPI environments.
It contains three options to order the matrices: minimum degree,
generalized nested dissection and multisection.
The matrices may be symmetric, Hermitian or nonsymmetric.
Pivoting for numerical stability is supported.
\par
While the functionality of the library is broad, 
the learning curve can be steep for the initial user.
We present in this paper some ``wrapper'' objects in the serial,
multithreaded and MPI environments that ease the transition.
They were originally written to integrate the {\bf SPOOLES} library
into CSAR's CSAR-Nastran library.
\par
The wrapper objects are presented as a learning device; anything
that reduces the interface between the user and the library also
restricts the ability to tune the library to a particular need.
This drawback is ameliorated by a number of wrapper methods that
allow the user to change default parameters that govern the
ordering, factorization and solve.
