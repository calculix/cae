The {\tt SubMtxList} structure has the following fields.
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\tt int nlist} : number of lists.
\item
{\tt SubMtx **heads} : 
vector of pointers to the heads of the list of {\tt SubMtx} objects.
\item
{\tt int *counts} : vector of incoming counts for the lists.
\item
{\tt Lock *lock} : mutual exclusion lock.
\item
{\tt char *flags} : vector of lock flags for the lists.
If {\tt flags[ilist] == 'N'}, the list does not need to be locked.
If {\tt flags[ilist] == 'Y'}, the list does need to be locked.
Used only when {\tt lock} is not {\tt NULL}.
\item
{\tt int nlocks} : 
total number of locks made on the mutual exclusion lock.
\end{itemize}
