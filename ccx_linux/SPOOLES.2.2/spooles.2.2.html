<h2>
SPOOLES 2.2 : SParse Object Oriented Linear Equations Solver
</h2>
<hr>
<b>SPOOLES</b> is a library for solving sparse real and complex
linear systems of equations, written in the C language using object
oriented design.
At present, there is the following functionality: 
<ol>
<li>
Compute multiple minimum degree, generalized nested dissection 
and multisection orderings of matrices with symmetric structure. 
</p>
<li>
Factor and solve square linear systems of equations with 
symmetric structure, with or without pivoting for stability. 
The factorization can be symmetric LDL<sup>T</sup>,
Hermitian LDL<sup>H</sup>, 
or nonsymmetric LDU. 
A direct factorization or a
drop tolerance factorization can be computed. 
The factors and solve can be done in serial
mode, multithreaded with Solaris or POSIX threads, or with MPI.
</p>
<li>
Factor and solve overdetermined full rank systems of equations
using a multifrontal QR factorization, in serial or using POSIX
threads.
</p>
<li>
Solve square linear systems using a variety of Krylov iterative
methods.
The preconditioner is a drop tolerance factorization, with or
without pivoting for stability.
</ol>

Changes since the 2.0 release.
<ol>
<li> Semi-implicit factorizations to reduce storage and/or
operation counts for direct and approximate factorizations.
(See the <tt> SemiImplMtx </tt> directory.)
</p>
<li> Krylov solvers for real SPD, symmetric indefinite,
and nonsymmetric linear systems. 
(See the <tt> Iter </tt> directory.)
The preconditioner is a drop tolerance approximate factorization 
obtained from the <tt> FrontMtx </tt> object.
There also exists a simpler ILU drop tolerance factorization
in the <tt> ILUMtx </tt> directory.
</p>
<li>
There is a "patch-and-go" functionality for factorizations
that must be modified on the fly.
One application is found in singular or near singular matrices
from structural analysis applications.
Another application is for matrices from interior point methods.
In both cases, the presence of a zero or small pivot element
requires special handling.
</p>
<li>
There is a "wrapper" object to solve linear systems
found in the <tt> LinSol </tt> directory.
It was used to incorporate the <b> SPOOLES </b> library into
the CSAR-Nastran finite element package.
</p>
<li>
There is a "wrapper" object used in an eigenanalysis package
found in the <tt> Eigen </tt> directory.
</p>
<li>
Several bugs were fixed in the multithreaded and MPI solvers.
Users of the <b> SPOOLES 2.0 </b> versions should upgrade.
</p>
<li>
The user manual and reference manual documentation has been
reorganized. There is a new <tt> documentation </tt>
directory, with five subdirectories:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<tt> documentation/Install </tt> holds 
"SPOOLES 2.2 Installation Manual",
the installation manual.
</p>
<li>
<tt> documentation/AllInOne </tt> holds 
"Solving Linear Systems using SPOOLES 2.2",
the driver programs manual.
</p>
<li>
<tt> documentation/FrontTrees </tt> holds 
"Ordering Sparse Matrices and Transforming Front Trees",
the ordering manual.
</p>
<li>
