\chapter{{\tt IVL}: Integer Vector List Object}
\par
The {\tt IVL} object is used to handle a list of {\tt int} vectors,
thus the acronym {\bf I}nteger {\bf V}ector {\bf L}ist.
The most common use is to represent a graph or the adjacency
structure of a matrix.
We have tried to make this object easy to use, and much hinges on
the ability to create new lists or change the size of a list.
In the interests of efficiency, this object is not a general
purpose storage object, i.e., free'd data is not reused.
