\chapter{{\tt Drand}: \break Simple Random Number Generator}
\par
Finding the same random number generator on a variety of UNIX
systems is not guaranteed to be a success.
Therefore, we wrote a simple random number generator object
taken from \cite{and90-random}.
The {\tt Drand} object provides both normally distributed and
uniformly distributed random numbers.
