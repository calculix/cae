\chapter{{\tt DenseMtx}: Dense matrix object}
\par
The {\tt DenseMtx} object contains a dense matrix along with row and
column indices.
The entries in the matrix can be double precision real or double
precision complex.
It needs to be able to manage its own storage, much like the {\tt
Chv} and {\tt SubMtx} objects that are used during the 
factor and solves, so we include
this capability via a contained {\tt DV} object.
A {\tt DenseMtx} object may also be found in a list, so there is
a {\tt next} field that points to another {\tt DenseMtx} object.
\par
The {\tt DenseMtx} object also exists in an MPI environment,
where it holds the solution and right hand side matrices.
Since each of these two matrices is distributed, a processor
{\it owns} only part of the global matrix, and so the need for row
and column indices to specify which rows and columns are present on
which processor.
