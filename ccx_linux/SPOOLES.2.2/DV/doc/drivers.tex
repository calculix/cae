testIO msglvl msgFile inFile outFile
\end{verbatim}
This driver program tests the {\tt DV} IO methods,
and is useful for translating between the formatted {\tt *.dvf}
and binary {\tt *.dvb} files.
\par
\begin{itemize}
\item
The {\tt msglvl} parameter determines the amount of output.
Use {\tt msglvl = 1} for just timing output.
\item
The {\tt msgFile} parameter determines the message file --- if {\tt
msgFile} is {\tt stdout}, then the message file is {\it stdout},
otherwise a file is opened with {\it append} status to receive any
output data.
\item
The {\tt inFile} parameter is the name of the file 
from which to read in the object.
{\tt inFile} must be of the form {\tt *.dvf} for a formatted file
or {\tt *.dvb} for a binary file.
\item
The {\tt outFile} parameter is the name of the file 
to which to write out the object.
If {\tt outfile} is of the form {\tt *.dvf}, the object is written
to a formatted file.
If {\tt outfile} is of the form {\tt *.dvb}, the object is written
to a binary file.
When {\tt outFile} is {\it not} {\tt "none"}, 
the object is written to the file in a human readable format.
When {\tt outFile} is {\tt "none"}, the object is not written out.
