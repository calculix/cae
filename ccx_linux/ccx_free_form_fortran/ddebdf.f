      !
      !         You have a choice of three differential equation solvers from
      !         DEPAC.  The following brief descriptions are meant to aid you
      !         in choosing the most appropriate code for your problem.
      !
      !         DDERKF is a fifth order Runge-Kutta code. It is the simplest of
      !         the three choices, both algorithmically and in the use of the
      !         code. DDERKF is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mild-
      !         ly stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations are
      !         not expensive.  It should generally not be used to get high
      !         accuracy results nor answers at a great many specific points.
      !         Because DDERKF has very low overhead costs, it will usually
      !         result in the least expensive integration when solving
      !         problems requiring a modest amount of accuracy and having
      !         equations that are not costly to evaluate.  DDERKF attempts to
      !         discover when it is not suitable for the task posed.
      !
      !         DDEABM is a variable order (one through twelve) Adams code. Its
      !         complexity lies somewhere between that of DDERKF and DDEBDF.
      !         DDEABM is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly
      !         stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations are
      !         expensive, high accuracy results are needed or answers at
      !         many specific points are required.  DDEABM attempts to discover
      !         when it is not suitable for the task posed.
      !
      !         DDEBDF is a variable order (one through five) backward
      !         differentiation formula code.  It is the most complicated of
      !         the three choices.  DDEBDF is primarily designed to solve stiff
      !         differential equations at crude to moderate tolerances.
      !         If the problem is very stiff at all, DDERKF and DDEABM will be
      !         quite inefficient compared to DDEBDF.  However, DDEBDF will be
      !         inefficient compared to DDERKF and DDEABM on non-stiff problems
      !         because it uses much more storage, has a much larger overhead,
      !         and the low order formulas will not give high accuracies
      !         efficiently.
      !
      !         The concept of stiffness cannot be described in a few words.
      !         If you do not know the problem to be stiff, try either DDERKF
      !         or DDEABM.  Both of these codes will inform you of stiffness
      !         when the cost of solving such problems becomes important.

      !  ** ABSTRACT **
      !  **********************************************************************
      !
      !    Subroutine DDEBDF uses the backward differentiation formulas of
      !    orders one through five to integrate a system of NEQ first order
      !    ordinary differential equations of the form
      !                          DU/DX = DF(X,U)
      !    when the vector Y(*) of initial values for U(*) at X=T is given.
      !    The subroutine integrates from T to TOUT. It is easy to continue the
      !    integration to get results at additional TOUT. This is the interval
      !    mode of operation. It is also easy for the routine to return with
      !    the solution at each intermediate step on the way to TOUT. This is
      !    the intermediate-output mode of operation.
      !

      !  * Description of The Arguments To DDEBDF (An Overview) *
      !  **********************************************************************
      !
      !    The Parameters are:
      !
      !       DF -- This is the name of a subroutine which you provide to
      !             define the differential equations.
      !
      !       NEQ -- This is the number of (first order) differential
      !              equations to be integrated.
      !
      !       T -- This is a DOUBLE PRECISION value of the independent
      !            variable.
      !
      !       Y(*) -- This DOUBLE PRECISION array contains the solution
      !               components at T.
      !
      !       TOUT -- This is a DOUBLE PRECISION point at which a solution is
      !               desired.
      !
      !       INFO(*) -- The basic task of the code is to integrate the
      !              differential equations from T to TOUT and return an
      !              answer at TOUT.  INFO(*) is an INTEGER array which is used
      !              to communicate exactly how you want this task to be
      !              carried out.
      !
      !       RTOL, ATOL -- These DOUBLE PRECISION quantities
      !              represent relative and absolute error tolerances which you
      !              provide to indicate how accurately you wish the solution
      !              to be computed.  You may choose them to be both scalars
      !              or else both vectors.
      !
      !       IDID -- This scalar quantity is an indicator reporting what
      !              the code did.  You must monitor this INTEGER variable to
      !              decide what action to take next.
      !
      !       RWORK(*), LRW -- RWORK(*) is a DOUBLE PRECISION work array of
      !              length LRW which provides the code with needed storage
      !              space.
      !
      !       IWORK(*), LIW -- IWORK(*) is an INTEGER work array of length LIW
      !              which provides the code with needed storage space and an
      !              across call flag.
      !
      !       RPAR, IPAR -- These are DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER parameter
      !              arrays which you can use for communication between your
      !              calling program and the DF subroutine (and the DJAC
      !              subroutine).
      !
      !       DJAC -- This is the name of a subroutine which you may choose to
      !              provide for defining the Jacobian matrix of partial
      !              derivatives DF/DU.
      !
      !   Quantities which are used as input items are
      !              NEQ, T, Y(*), TOUT, INFO(*),
      !              RTOL, ATOL, RWORK(1), LRW,
      !              IWORK(1), IWORK(2), and LIW.
      !
      !   Quantities which may be altered by the code are
      !              T, Y(*), INFO(1), RTOL, ATOL,
      !              IDID, RWORK(*) and IWORK(*).
      !
      !  **********************************************************************
      !  * INPUT -- What To Do On The First Call To DDEBDF *
      !  **********************************************************************
      !
      !    The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new
      !    problem.  Read through the descriptions of all the following items,
      !    provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set
      !    appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and
      !    give information about how you want the problem to be solved.
      !
      !
      !       DF -- Provide a subroutine of the form
      !                                DF(X,U,UPRIME,RPAR,IPAR)
      !              to define the system of first order differential equations
      !              which is to be solved. For the given values of X and the
      !              vector  U(*)=(U(1),U(2),...,U(NEQ)) , the subroutine must
      !              evaluate the NEQ components of the system of differential
      !              equations  DU/DX=DF(X,U)  and store the derivatives in the
      !              array UPRIME(*), that is,  UPRIME(I) = * DU(I)/DX *  for
      !              equations I=1,...,NEQ.
      !
      !              Subroutine DF must not alter X or U(*). You must declare
      !              the name DF in an external statement in your program that
      !              calls DDEBDF. You must dimension U and UPRIME in DF.
      !
      !              RPAR and IPAR are DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER parameter
      !              arrays which you can use for communication between your
      !              calling program and subroutine DF. They are not used or
      !              altered by DDEBDF.  If you do not need RPAR or IPAR,
      !              ignore these parameters by treating them as dummy
      !              arguments. If you do choose to use them, dimension them in
      !              your calling program and in DF as arrays of appropriate
      !              length.
      !
      !       NEQ -- Set it to the number of differential equations.
      !              (NEQ .GE. 1)
      !
      !       T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration.
      !              You must use a program variable for T because the code
      !              changes its value.
      !
      !       Y(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of the NEQ solution
      !              components at the initial point.  You must dimension Y at
      !              least NEQ in your calling program.
      !
      !       TOUT -- Set it to the first point at which a solution is desired.
      !              You can take TOUT = T, in which case the code
      !              will evaluate the derivative of the solution at T and
      !              return.  Integration either forward in T  (TOUT .GT. T)
      !              or backward in T  (TOUT .LT. T)  is permitted.
      !
      !              The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using
      !              step sizes which are automatically selected so as to
      !              achieve the desired accuracy.  If you wish, the code will
      !              return with the solution and its derivative following
      !              each intermediate step (intermediate-output mode) so that
      !              you can monitor them, but you still must provide TOUT in
      !              accord with the basic aim of the code.
      !
      !              The first step taken by the code is a critical one
      !              because it must reflect how fast the solution changes near
      !              the initial point.  The code automatically selects an
      !              initial step size which is practically always suitable for
      !              the problem.  By using the fact that the code will not
      !              step past TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary,
      !              restrict the length of the initial step size.
      !
      !              For some problems it may not be permissible to integrate
      !              past a point TSTOP because a discontinuity occurs there
      !              or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond
      !              TSTOP.  When you have declared a TSTOP point (see INFO(4)
      !              and RWORK(1)), you have told the code not to integrate
      !              past TSTOP.  In this case any TOUT beyond TSTOP is invalid
      !              input.
      !
      !       INFO(*) -- Use the INFO array to give the code more details about
      !              how you want your problem solved.  This array should be
      !              dimensioned of length 15 to accommodate other members of
      !              DEPAC or possible future extensions, though DDEBDF uses
      !              only the first six entries.  You must respond to all of
      !              the following items which are arranged as questions.  The
      !              simplest use of the code corresponds to answering all
      !              questions as YES ,i.e. setting all entries of INFO to 0.
      !
      !         INFO(1) -- This parameter enables the code to initialize
      !                itself.  You must set it to indicate the start of every
      !                new problem.
      !
      !             **** Is this the first call for this problem ...
      !                   YES -- Set INFO(1) = 0
      !                    NO -- Not applicable here.
      !                          See below for continuation calls.  ****
      !
      !         INFO(2) -- How much accuracy you want of your solution
      !                is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL.
      !                The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars.
      !                To obtain more flexibility, they can both be vectors.
      !                The code must be told your choice.
      !
      !             **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ...
      !                   YES -- Set INFO(2) = 0
      !                          and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL
      !                    NO -- Set INFO(2) = 1
      !                          and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL ****
      !
      !         INFO(3) -- The code integrates from T in the direction
      !                of TOUT by steps.  If you wish, it will return the
      !                computed solution and derivative at the next
      !                intermediate step (the intermediate-output mode) or
      !                TOUT, whichever comes first.  This is a good way to
      !                proceed if you want to see the behavior of the solution.
      !                If you must have solutions at a great many specific
      !                TOUT points, this code will compute them efficiently.
      !
      !             **** Do you want the solution only at
      !                  TOUT (and NOT at the next intermediate step) ...
      !                   YES -- Set INFO(3) = 0
      !                    NO -- Set INFO(3) = 1 ****
      !
      !         INFO(4) -- To handle solutions at a great many specific
      !                values TOUT efficiently, this code may integrate past
      !                TOUT and interpolate to obtain the result at TOUT.
      !                Sometimes it is not possible to integrate beyond some
      !                point TSTOP because the equation changes there or it is
      !                not defined past TSTOP.  Then you must tell the code
      !                not to go past.
      !
      !             **** Can the integration be carried out without any
      !                  restrictions on the independent variable T ...
      !                   YES -- Set INFO(4)=0
      !                    NO -- Set INFO(4)=1
      !                          and define the stopping point TSTOP by
      !                          setting RWORK(1)=TSTOP ****
      !
      !         INFO(5) -- To solve stiff problems it is necessary to use the
      !                Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of the system
      !                of differential equations.  If you do not provide a
      !                subroutine to evaluate it analytically (see the
      !                description of the item DJAC in the call list), it will
      !                be approximated by numerical differencing in this code.
      !                Although it is less trouble for you to have the code
      !                compute partial derivatives by numerical differencing,
      !                the solution will be more reliable if you provide the
      !                derivatives via DJAC.  Sometimes numerical differencing
      !                is cheaper than evaluating derivatives in DJAC and
      !                sometimes it is not - this depends on your problem.
      !
      !                If your problem is linear, i.e. has the form
      !                DU/DX = DF(X,U) = J(X)*U + G(X)   for some matrix J(X)
      !                and vector G(X), the Jacobian matrix  DF/DU = J(X).
      !                Since you must provide a subroutine to evaluate DF(X,U)
      !                analytically, it is little extra trouble to provide
      !                subroutine DJAC for evaluating J(X) analytically.
      !                Furthermore, in such cases, numerical differencing is
      !                much more expensive than analytic evaluation.
      !
      !             **** Do you want the code to evaluate the partial
      !                  derivatives automatically by numerical differences ...

      !         INFO(6) -- DDEBDF will perform much better if the Jacobian
      !                matrix is banded and the code is told this.  In this
      !                case, the storage needed will be greatly reduced,
      !                numerical differencing will be performed more cheaply,
      !                and a number of important algorithms will execute much
      !                faster.  The differential equation is said to have
      !                half-bandwidths ML (lower) and MU (upper) if equation I
      !                involves only unknowns Y(J) with
      !                               I-ML .LE. J .LE. I+MU
      !                for all I=1,2,...,NEQ.  Thus, ML and MU are the widths
      !                of the lower and upper parts of the band, respectively,
      !                with the main diagonal being excluded.  If you do not
      !                indicate that the equation has a banded Jacobian,
      !                the code works with a full matrix of NEQ**2 elements
      !                (stored in the conventional way).  Computations with
      !                banded matrices cost less time and storage than with
      !                full matrices if  2*ML+MU .LT. NEQ.  If you tell the
      !                code that the Jacobian matrix has a banded structure and
      !                you want to provide subroutine DJAC to compute the

      !       RTOL, ATOL -- You must assign relative (RTOL) and absolute (ATOL)
      !              error tolerances to tell the code how accurately you want
      !              the solution to be computed.  They must be defined as
      !              program variables because the code may change them.  You
      !              have two choices --
      !                   Both RTOL and ATOL are scalars. (INFO(2)=0)
      !                   Both RTOL and ATOL are vectors. (INFO(2)=1)
      !              In either case all components must be non-negative.
      !
      !              The tolerances are used by the code in a local error test
      !              at each step which requires roughly that
      !                      ABS(LOCAL ERROR) .LE. RTOL*ABS(Y)+ATOL
      !              for each vector component.
      !              (More specifically, a root-mean-square norm is used to
      !              measure the size of vectors, and the error test uses the
      !              magnitude of the solution at the beginning of the step.)
      !
      !              The true (global) error is the difference between the true
      !              solution of the initial value problem and the computed
      !              approximation.  Practically all present day codes,
      !              including this one, control the local error at each step
      !              and do not even attempt to control the global error
      !              directly.  Roughly speaking, they produce a solution Y(T)
      !              which satisfies the differential equations with a
      !              residual R(T),    DY(T)/DT = DF(T,Y(T)) + R(T)   ,
      !              and, almost always, R(T) is bounded by the error
      !              tolerances.  Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of
      !              the computed Y is comparable to the error tolerances. This
      !              code will usually, but not always, deliver a more accurate
      !              solution if you reduce the tolerances and integrate again.
      !              By comparing two such solutions you can get a fairly
      !              reliable idea of the true error in the solution at the
      !              bigger tolerances.
      !
      !              Setting ATOL=0. results in a pure relative error test on
      !              that component.  Setting RTOL=0. results in a pure abso-
      !              lute error test on that component.  A mixed test with non-
      !              zero RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a relative error
      !              test when the solution component is much bigger than ATOL
      !              and to an absolute error test when the solution component
      !              is smaller than the threshold ATOL.
      !
      !              Proper selection of the absolute error control parameters
      !              ATOL  requires you to have some idea of the scale of the
      !              solution components.  To acquire this information may mean
      !              that you will have to solve the problem more than once. In
      !              the absence of scale information, you should ask for some
      !              relative accuracy in all the components (by setting  RTOL
      !              values non-zero) and perhaps impose extremely small
      !              absolute error tolerances to protect against the danger of
      !              a solution component becoming zero.
      !
      !              The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an
      !              accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used.  It will
      !              advise you if you ask for too much accuracy and inform
      !              you as to the maximum accuracy it believes possible.

      !                         integration has reached.  This will be

      !  ** INPUT -- What To Do To Continue The Integration **
      !  **             (calls after the first)             **
      !  **********************************************************************
      !
      !         This code is organized so that subsequent calls to continue the
      !         integration involve little (if any) additional effort on your
      !         part. You must monitor the IDID parameter in order to determine
      !         what to do next.
      !
      !         Recalling that the principal task of the code is to integrate
      !         from T to TOUT (the interval mode), usually all you will need
      !         to do is specify a new TOUT upon reaching the current TOUT.
      !
      !         Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below,
      !         in particular do not alter NEQ, T, Y(*), RWORK(*), IWORK(*) or
      !         the differential equation in subroutine DF. Any such alteration
      !         constitutes a new problem and must be treated as such, i.e.
      !         you must start afresh.
      !
      !         You cannot change from vector to scalar error control or vice
      !         versa (INFO(2)) but you can change the size of the entries of
      !         RTOL, ATOL.  Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier
      !         to integrate.  Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation
      !         harder to integrate and should generally be avoided.
      !
      !         You can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the
      !         interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time.
      !
      !         If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going
      !         past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the
      !         code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently
      !         specified TSTOP.  Once TSTOP has been reached you must change
      !         the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4)=0.  You may change INFO(4)
      !         or TSTOP at any time but you must supply the value of TSTOP in
      !         RWORK(1) whenever you set INFO(4)=1.
      !
      !         Do not change INFO(5), INFO(6), IWORK(1), or IWORK(2)
      !         unless you are going to restart the code.
      !
      !         The parameter INFO(1) is used by the code to indicate the
      !         beginning of a new problem and to indicate whether integration
      !         is to be continued.  You must input the value  INFO(1) = 0
      !         when starting a new problem.  You must input the value
      !         INFO(1) = 1  if you wish to continue after an interrupted task.
      !         Do not set  INFO(1) = 0  on a continuation call unless you
      !         want the code to restart at the current T.
      !
      !                          *** Following a Completed Task ***
      !          If
      !              IDID = 1, call the code again to continue the integration
      !                      another step in the direction of TOUT.
      !
      !              IDID = 2 or 3, define a new TOUT and call the code again.
      !                      TOUT must be different from T.  You cannot change
      !                      the direction of integration without restarting.
      !
      !                          *** Following an Interrupted Task ***
      !                      To show the code that you realize the task was
      !                      interrupted and that you want to continue, you
      !                      must take appropriate action and reset INFO(1) = 1
      !          If
      !              IDID = -1, the code has attempted 500 steps.
      !                      If you want to continue, set INFO(1) = 1 and
      !                      call the code again.  An additional 500 steps
      !                      will be allowed.
      !
      !              IDID = -2, the error tolerances RTOL, ATOL have been
      !                      increased to values the code estimates appropriate
      !                      for continuing.  You may want to change them
      !                      yourself.  If you are sure you want to continue
      !                      with relaxed error tolerances, set INFO(1)=1 and
      !                      call the code again.
      !
      !              IDID = -3, a solution component is zero and you set the
      !                      corresponding component of ATOL to zero.  If you
      !                      are sure you want to continue, you must first
      !                      alter the error criterion to use positive values
      !                      for those components of ATOL corresponding to zero
      !                      solution components, then set INFO(1)=1 and call
      !                      the code again.
      !
      !              IDID = -4,-5  --- cannot occur with this code but used
      !                      by other members of DEPAC.
      !
      !              IDID = -6, repeated convergence test failures occurred
      !                      on the last attempted step in DDEBDF.  An inaccu-

      !                      absolutely certain you want to continue, restart
      !                      the integration at the current T by setting

      ! ***DESCRIPTION
      !
      !    DSTOD integrates a system of first order odes over one step in the
      !    integrator package DDEBDF.
      !  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      !  DSTOD  performs one step of the integration of an initial value
      !  problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
      !  Note.. DSTOD  is independent of the value of the iteration method
      !  indicator MITER, when this is .NE. 0, and hence is independent
      !  of the type of chord method used, or the Jacobian structure.
      !  Communication with DSTOD  is done with the following variables..
      !
      !  Y      = An array of length .GE. N used as the Y argument in
      !           all calls to DF and DJAC.
      !  NEQ    = Integer array containing problem size in NEQ(1), and
      !           passed as the NEQ argument in all calls to DF and DJAC.
      !  YH     = An NYH by LMAX array containing the dependent variables
      !           and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
      !           LMAX = MAXORD + 1.  YH(I,J+1) contains the approximate
      !           J-th derivative of Y(I), scaled by H**J/FACTORIAL(J)
      !           (J = 0,1,...,NQ).  On entry for the first step, the first
      !           two columns of YH must be set from the initial values.
      !  NYH    = A constant integer .GE. N, the first dimension of YH.
      !  YH1    = A one-dimensional array occupying the same space as YH.
      !  EWT    = An array of N elements with which the estimated local
      !           errors in YH are compared.
      !  SAVF   = An array of working storage, of length N.
      !  ACOR   = A work array of length N, used for the accumulated
      !           corrections.  On a successful return, ACOR(I) contains
      !           the estimated one-step local error in Y(I).
      !  WM,IWM = DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER work arrays associated with
      !           matrix operations in chord iteration (MITER .NE. 0).
      !  DPJAC   = Name of routine to evaluate and preprocess Jacobian matrix
      !           if a chord method is being used.
      !  DSLVS   = Name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
      !  H      = The step size to be attempted on the next step.
      !           H is altered by the error control algorithm during the
      !           problem.  H can be either positive or negative, but its
      !           sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
      !  HMIN   = The minimum absolute value of the step size H to be used.
      !  HMXI   = Inverse of the maximum absolute value of H to be used.
      !           HMXI = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite HMAX.
      !           HMIN and HMXI may be changed at any time, but will not
      !           take effect until the next change of H is considered.
      !  TN     = The independent variable. TN is updated on each step taken.
      !  JSTART = An integer used for input only, with the following
      !           values and meanings..
      !                0  Perform the first step.
      !            .GT.0  Take a new step continuing from the last.
      !               -1  Take the next step with a new value of H, MAXORD,
      !                     N, METH, MITER, and/or matrix parameters.
      !               -2  Take the next step with a new value of H,
      !                     but with other inputs unchanged.
      !           On return, JSTART is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
      !  KFLAG  = a completion code with the following meanings..
      !                0  The step was successful.
      !               -1  The requested error could not be achieved.

      ! ***DESCRIPTION
      !
      !    DINTYD approximates the solution and derivatives at T by polynomial
      !    interpolation. Must be used in conjunction with the integrator
      !    package DDEBDF.
      !  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      !  DINTYD computes interpolated values of the K-th derivative of the
      !  dependent variable vector Y, and stores it in DKY.
      !  This routine is called by DDEBDF with K = 0,1 and T = TOUT, but may
      !  also be called by the user for any K up to the current order.
      !  (see detailed instructions in LSODE usage documentation.)
      !  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      !  The computed values in DKY are gotten by interpolation using the
      !  Nordsieck history array YH.  This array corresponds uniquely to a
      !  vector-valued polynomial of degree NQCUR or less, and DKY is set
      !  to the K-th derivative of this polynomial at T.
      !  The formula for DKY is..
      !               Q
      !   DKY(I)  =  Sum  C(J,K) * (T - TN)**(J-K) * H**(-J) * YH(I,J+1)
      !              J=K
      !  where  C(J,K) = J*(J-1)*...*(J-K+1), Q = NQCUR, TN = TCUR, H = HCUR.
      !  The quantities  NQ = NQCUR, L = NQ+1, N = NEQ, TN, and H are
      !  communicated by common.  The above sum is done in reverse order.
      !  IFLAG is returned negative if either K or T is out of bounds.
