!     this subroutines enables to calculate the critical pressure ratio of a straight
!     labyrinth seal as a function of the number of spikes (n).
!
!     The following table is obtained by solving iteratively the equation :
!     Ps_inf/Pt0=ppkrit=1/dsqrt(1+2.n-ln(ppkrit))
!
!     this equation can be found by using the formula for the ideal mass flow in a straight labyrinth
!     see "Air system Correlations Part 1 : Labyrith Seals" H.Zimmermann and K.H. Wollf ASME98-GT-206
!     and determining the maximum flow for a given number of fin.
