!     calculating h0 on the interface between A or A-V domains and
!     the phi-domain. At the start of the routine h0 is available in
!     the complete phi-domain. Using the MPC's developed in tiedcontact
!     to tie the phi-values at the border of the A or A-V domains to
!     those in the phi-domain, the h0 values are calculated in a
!     similar way
