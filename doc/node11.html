Seepage under a dam</A>
</H2>

<P>
In this section, groundwater flow under a dam is analyzed. The geometry of the
dam is depicted in Figure <A HREF="#damgeo">20</A> and is taken from exercise 30 in
Chapter 1 of [<A
 HREF="node448.html#Harr">27</A>]. All length measurements are in feet (0.3048 m). The
water level upstream of the dam is 20 feet high, on the downstream side it is
5 feet high. The soil underneath the dam is anisotropic. Upstream the
permeability  is
characterized by <!-- MATH

hydraulic gradient, i.e. <IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img122.png"
 ALT="$ \nabla h$"> since this is a measure whether or
not piping will occur. Piping means that the soil is being carried away by the
groundwater flow (usually at the downstream side) and constitutes an instable
condition. As a rule of thumb, piping will occur if the hydraulic gradient is
about unity.

<P>
From Section <A HREF="node173.html#stationarygroundwaterflow">6.9.14</A> we know that the equations
governing stationary groundwater flow are the same as the heat equations. The
equivalent quantity of the total head is the temperature and of the velocity
it is the heat flow. For the finite element analysis SI units were taken, so
feet was converted into meter. Furthermore, a vertical impermeable wall was
assumed far upstream and far downstream (actually, 30 m upstream from the
middle point of the dam and 30 m downstream).

<P>
Now, the boundary conditions are:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>the dam, the left and right vertical boundaries upstream and downstream, and
the horizontal limit at the bottom are impermeable. This means that the
water velocity perpendicular to these boundaries is zero, or, equivalently,
the heat flux.
</LI>
<LI>taking the reference for the z-coordinate in the definition of total head at
the bottom of the dam (see Equation <A HREF="node173.html#deftotalhead">330</A> for the definition of
total head), and assuming that the atmospheric pressure <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img123.png"
 ALT="$ p_0$"> is
zero, the total head upstream is 28 feet and downstream it is 13 feet. In the
thermal equivalent this corresponds to temperature boundary conditions.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The input deck is summarized in Figure <A HREF="#daminp">21</A>. The complete deck is part
of the example problems. The problem is really two-dimensional and
consequently qu8 elements were used for the mesh generation within CalculiX
GraphiX. To obtain a higher resolution immediately adjacent to the dam a bias
was used (the mesh can be seen in Figure <A HREF="#dam1">22</A>).

At the start of the deck the nodes are defined and the topology of the
elements. The qu8 element type in CalculiX GraphiX is by default translated
by the send command into a S8 (shell) element in CalculiX CrunchiX. However, a plane element is
here more appropriate. Since the calculation at stake is thermal and not
mechanical, it is really immaterial whether one takes plane strain (CPE8) or
plane stress (CPS8) elements. With the *ELSET keyword the element sets for the
two different kinds of soil are defined. The nodes on which the constant total
head is to be applied are defined by *NSET cards. The permeability of the soil
corresponds to the heat conduction coefficient in a thermal analysis. Notice
that the permeability is defined to be orthotropic, using the
*CONDUCTIVITY,TYPE=ORTHO card. The values beneath this card are the
permeability in x, y and z-direction (SI units: m/s). The value for the
z-direction is actually immaterial, since no gradient is expected in that
direction. The *SOLID SECTION card is used to assign the
materials to the appropriate soil regions. The *INITIAL CONDITIONS card is not
really needed, since the calculation is stationary, however, CalculiX CrunchiX
formally needs it in a heat transfer calculation.

<P>
Within the step a *HEAT TRANSFER, STEADY STATE calculation is selected without
any additional time step information. This means that the defaults for the step
length (1) and initial increment size (1) will be taken. With the *BOUNDARY
cards the total head upstream and downstream is defined (11 is the temperature
degree of freedom). Finally, the *NODE
PRINT, *NODE FILE and *EL FILE cards are used to define the output: NT is the
temperature, or, equivalently, the total head (Figure <A HREF="#dam1">22</A>) , and HFL is the heat flux, or,
equivalently, the groundwater flow velocity (y-component in Figure <A HREF="#dam2">23</A>). 

<P>
Since the permeability upstream is high, the total head gradient is small. The
converse is true downstream. The flow velocity is especially important
downstream. There it reaches values up to <!-- MATH
 $2.25 \times 10^{-4}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img128.png"
 ALT="$ 2.25 \times 10^{-4}$"> m/s (the red
spot in Figure <A HREF="#dam2">23</A>), which
corresponds to a hydraulic gradient of about 0.56, since the permeability in
y-direction downstream is <!-- MATH
 $4 \times 10^{-4}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img129.png"
 ALT="$ 4 \times 10^{-4}$"> m/s. This is smaller than 1, so
no piping will occur. Notice that the velocity is naturally highest
immediately next to the dam.

<P>
This example shows how seepage problems can be solved by using the heat
transfer capabilities in CalculiX GraphiX. The same applies to any other
phenomenon governed by a Laplace-type equation.
