Determining the basic characteristics of the network</A>
</H3>

<P>
In subroutine envtemp.f the basic properties of the network are determined. It
is called at the start of nonlingeo.c. At first the gas nodes are identified
and sorted. A node is a gas node if any of the following conditions is
satisfied:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>it is used as environment node of a forced convection <A HREF="node261.html#film">*FILM</A> boundary
  condition. The temperature in such a node is an unknown. This also implies
  that a midside node of a network element cannot be used as environment node in
  a *FILM condition.
</LI>
<LI>it is used as environment node of a forced convection *DLOAD boundary
  condition. The total pressure in such a node is unknown (the static pressure
  may be more applicable for gas networks, this has not been implemented yet).
</LI>
<LI>it belongs to a network element. If it is an corner node the total
  temperature and the total pressure are unknowns, if it is a midside node the
  mass flow is unknown and the geometry may be unknown too.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In that way also the field nactdog is filled (with the value 1 for an unknown
variable, 0 else). Next, the known boundary values
(<A HREF="node209.html#boundary">*BOUNDARY</A> cards) are subtracted, and the unknown DOFs are
numbered consecutively yielding the final form for nactdog. Notice that the
global number of gas node i is itg(i). Since field its is ordered in an
ascending order, subroutine nident.f can be used to find the local gas node
number for a given global number. In the remaining test ``gas node i'' refers
to the local number whereas ``node i'' refers to a global number.

<P>
In a loop over all network elements the necessary equations are determined. In a
given corner node the conservation of mass equation is formulated if the mass
flow in at least one of the adjacent network elements is unknown. The
conservation of energy is written if the temperature in the corner node is
unknown. Finally, conservation of momentum equation (also called element
equation) is formulated for a midside node of a network element if not all
quantities in the element equation are known. This latter check is performed
in the subroutine flux.f (characterized by iflag=0). It contains on its own subroutines for several
fluid section types, e.g. subroutine orifice.f for the fluid section of type
ORIFICE. The number of unknowns relevant for the network element depends on its
section type. After having identified all necessary equations in field nacteq
they are numbered and the number of equations is compared with the number of
unknowns. They must be equal in order to have a unique solution.

<P>
Next, multiple point constraints among network nodes are taken into
account. They are defined using the *EQUATION keyword card. It is not allowed
to use network nodes and non-network nodes in one and the same equation.

<P>
Finally, dependent
and independent nodes are determined for each isothermal element and the
appropriate entries in field nacteq (third row, cf. previous section) are
defined. If at the stage of the matrix filling an corner node is a dependent node
of an isothermal element the conservation of energy equation in that node is
replaced by an equation that the static temperature in the dependent and
independent node are equal. Fields ipogn and ign are deleted after leaving
envtemp.f
