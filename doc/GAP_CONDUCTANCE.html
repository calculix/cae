The conductance is the ratio of the heat flow across the contact location and the temperature difference between the corresponding slave and master surface (unit: [energy]/([time]*[area]*[temperature])). The gap conductance is a property of the nonlinear contact spring elements generated during contact. This means that heat flow will only take place at those slave nodes, at which a contact spring element was generated. Whether or not a contact spring element is generated depends on the pressure-overclosure relationship on the *SURFACE   BEHAVIOR card.   <P>  <UL> <LI>for node-to-face contact:  <UL> <LI>if the pressure-overclosure relationship is linear or tabular a contact spring   element is generated if the gap clearance does not exceed <!-- MATH  $c_0   \sqrt{A}$  --> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG  WIDTH="43" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"  SRC="img2256.png"  ALT="$ c_0 \sqrt{A}$"></B></SPAN>, where A is the representative area at the slave node, or   <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG  WIDTH="43" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"  SRC="img820.png"  ALT="$ 10^{-10}$"></B></SPAN> if this area is zero (can happen for 2-dimensional   elements).

Alternatively, the conductance can be coded by the user in the user subroutine gapcon.f, cf Section 9.4.11. In the latter case the option USER must be used on the *GAP CONDUCTANCE card.  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*GAP CONDUCTANCE </LI> <LI>Enter the parameter USER if appropriate </LI> </UL>  <P> Following sets of lines define the conductance coefficients in the absence of the USER parameter: First line in the first set:  <UL> <LI>Conductance. </LI> <LI>Contact pressure. </LI> <LI>Temperature. </LI> </UL> Use as many lines in the first set as needed to define the conductance versus pressure curve for this temperature.  <P> Use as many sets as needed to define complete temperature dependence.  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> <PRE>
