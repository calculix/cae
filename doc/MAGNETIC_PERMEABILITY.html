There are no parameters. The material is supposed to be isotropic. The constant may be temperature dependent. The unit of the magnetic permeability coefficient is the unit of force divided by the square of the unit of electrical current. In SI-units this is N/A<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG  WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"  SRC="img3.png"  ALT="$ ^2$"></B></SPAN> or Henry/m. The magnetic permeability may be viewed as the product of the relative magnetic permeability (dimensionless) <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG  WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"  SRC="img2325.png"  ALT="$ \mu_r$"></B></SPAN> with the permeability of vacuum <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG  WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"  SRC="img2326.png"  ALT="$ \mu_0$"></B></SPAN>.   <P> Following the magnetic permeability constant the user is supposed to define the domain for which this material is used. In an electromagnetic calculation there are three domains:  <P>  <OL> <LI>the air, which is the P-domain (domain 1) </LI> <LI>the bodies, which is the A,V-domain (domain 2) </LI> <LI>that part of the air, which, if filled with body material, ensures that   the bodies are simply connected; this is the A-domain (domain 3). If there is only one   body and if it is such that   it is naturally simply connected the A-domain is empty. </LI> </OL>  <P> For more details the reader is referred to the section on electromagnetism.  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*MAGNETIC PERMEABILITY </LI> </UL>  <P> Following line:  <UL> <LI><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG  WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"  SRC="img48.png"  ALT="$ \mu$"></B></SPAN>. </LI> <LI>number of the domain </LI> <LI>Temperature. </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed to define complete temperature dependence.  <P> <PRE>
Example:
