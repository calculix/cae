A distributing constraint specifies that a force or a moment in the reference node is distributed among the nodes belonging to the element surface. The weights are calculated from the area within the surface the reference node corresponds with.  <P> The *DISTRIBUTING card must be immediately preceded by a *COUPLING keyword card, specifying the reference node and the element surface. If no ORIENTATION was specified on the *COUPLING card, the degrees of freedom apply to the global rectangular system, if an ORIENTATION was used, they apply to the local system. For a *DISTRIBUTING constraint the local system cannot be cylindrical.  <P> The degrees of freedom to which the distributing constraint should apply, have to be specified underneath the *DISTRIBUTING card. They should belong to the range 1 to 6. Degrees of freedom 1 to 3 correspond to translations along the local axes, if any, else the global axes are taken. Degrees of freedom 4 to 6 correspond to rotations about the local axes (4 about the local x-axis and so on), if any, else the global axes are taken. No matter what the user specifies, the translations are always distributed (degree of freedom 1 to 3). Consequently, the only freedom the user has is to decide whether any additional rotational degrees of freedom should be distributed.  <P> The degrees of freedom in the reference node can be constrained by a *BOUNDARY card, or a corresponding force/moment can be applied by a *CLOAD card. The displacements in the reference node can be obtained by selecting U on the *NODE   PRINT card. The rotation about the reference node cannot be printed. In order to obtain the force and/or moment in the reference node the user should use *SECTION PRINT to obtain the global force and moment on the selected surface.  <P> A *DISTRIBUTING coupling is usually selected in order to distribute a force or moment area-weighted among the nodes of a surface. In case of a bending moment or torque the rotation takes place about the center of gravity of the surface. Nodes close to the center of gravity usually deteriorate the convergence.  <P> In CalculiX, the *DISTRIBUTING contraint is linear, i.e. the coefficients of the constraint are not updated during the calculation.  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*DISTRIBUTING </LI> </UL>  <P> Following line:  <UL> <LI>first degree of freedom (only 1 to 6 allowed) </LI> <LI>last degree of freedom (only 1 to 6 allowed); if left blank the last   degree of freedom coincides with the first degree of freedom. </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed to constrain other degrees of freedom.  <P> <PRE>
