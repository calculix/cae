*CLOAD
</H2>

<P>
Keyword type: step

<P>
This option allows concentrated forces to be applied to any node in
the model which is not fixed by a single or multiple point
constraint. Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, USER, LOAD CASE,
SECTOR, SUBMODEL, STEP, DATA SET and OMEGA0. OP can take the
value NEW or MOD. OP=MOD is default and implies that the concentrated
loads applied to different nodes in previous steps are kept. Specifying a force in a node for which a
force was defined in a previous step replaces this value. A force specified in
a node and direction for which a force was already defined within the same step is added to
this value. OP=NEW
implies that all concentrated loads applied in previous steps are removed. If
multiple *CLOAD cards are present in a step this parameter takes effect for the first *CLOAD card only. 

<P>
The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitude by which
the force values are scaled (mainly used for nonlinear static and dynamic
calculations). Thus, in that case the values entered on the *CLOAD card are
interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the (time dependent)
amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At the end of the step the
reference value is replaced by the actual value at that time. In subsequent
steps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or the
amplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keeps
its validity.

<P>
The AMPLITUDE parameter applies to all loads specified by the same *CLOAD
card. This means that, by using several *CLOAD cards, different amplitudes can
be applied to the forces in different coordinate directions in one and the
same node. An important exception to this rule are nodes in which a
transformation applies (by using the <A HREF="node367.html#transform">*TRANSFORM</A> card): an
amplitude defined for such a node applies to ALL coordinate directions. If
several are defined, the last one applies.

<P>
The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAY
must be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which the
AMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. For
instance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is taken
which applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once on
one and the same keyword card.

<P>
If the USER parameter is selected the concentrated load values are determined by
calling the user subroutine <A HREF="node383.html#usercload">cload.f</A>, which
must be provided by the user. This applies to all nodes listed
beneath the *CLOAD keyword. Any load values specified following the
degree of freedom are not taken into account. If the USER parameter is selected,
the AMPLITUDE parameter has no effect and should not be used. 

<P>
The LOAD CASE parameter is only active in <A HREF="node356.html#steadystatedynamics">*STEADY STATE
DYNAMICS</A> calculations. LOAD CASE = 1 means that the
loading is real or in-phase.  LOAD CASE = 2 indicates that the load is
imaginary or equivalently phase-shifted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img616.png"
 ALT="$ 90 ^\circ$"></B></SPAN>. Default is LOAD CASE =
1.

<P>
The SECTOR parameter can only be used in <A HREF="node324.html#modaldynamic">*MODAL
DYNAMIC</A> and <A HREF="node356.html#steadystatedynamics">*STEADY STATE
DYNAMICS</A> calculations with cyclic symmetry. The datum
sector (the sector which is modeled) is sector 1. The other sectors are
numbered in increasing order in the rotational direction going from the slave
surface to the master surface as specified by the <A HREF="node365.html#tie">*TIE</A>
card. Consequently, the SECTOR parameters allows to apply a point load to any
node in any sector. However, the only coordinate systems allowed in a node in which a force is applied in a sector
different from the datum sector are restricted to the global Carthesian system and a local
cylindrical system. If the global coordinate system applies, the force defined by the user
(in the global system) is simply copied to the appropriate sector without
changing its direction. The user must make sure the direction of the force is
the one needed in the destination sector. If a local cylindrical system
applies, this system must be identical with the one defined underneath the
<A HREF="node276.html#cyclicsymmetrymodel">*CYCLIC SYMMETRY MODEL</A> card. In that case, the
force defined in the datum sector is rotated towards the destination sector,
i.e. the radial, circumferential and axial part of the force is kept.

<P>
The SUBMODEL parameter specifies that the forces in the specified degrees of
freedom of the nodes
listed underneath will be obtained by interpolation from a global model. To
this end these nodes have to be part of a
<A HREF="node358.html#submodel">*SUBMODEL</A>,TYPE=NODE card. On the latter card the result
file (frd file) of the global model is defined. The use of the SUBMODEL
parameter requires the STEP  or the DATA SET parameter. 

<P>
In case the global
calculation was a *STATIC calculation the STEP parameter specifies the step in the global model
which will be used for the interpolation. If results for more than one
increment within the step are stored, the last increment is taken. 

<P>
In case the global calculation was a *FREQUENCY calculation the DATA SET parameter
specifies the mode in the global model which will be used for the
interpolation. It is the number preceding the string MODAL in the .frd-file
and it corresponds to the dataset number if viewing the .frd-file with
CalculiX GraphiX.  Notice that the global frequency calculation is not allowed
to contain preloading nor cyclic symmetry.

<P>
Notice that the forces
interpolated from
the global model are not transformed, no matter what coordinate system is
applied to the nodes in the submodel. Consequently, if the forces of the global model
are stored in a local coordinate system, this local system also applies to the
submodel nodes in which these forces are interpolated. So the submodel nodes in which the forces of the global model are
interpolated, inherit the coordinate system in which the forces of the
global model were stored. The SUBMODEL parameter and the AMPLITUDE parameter
are mutually exclusive.

<P>
Notice that the interpolation of the forces from a global model onto a
submodel is only correct if the global and submodel mesh coincide. Else, force
equilibrium is violated. Therefore, the option to interpolate forces on
submodels only makes sense if it is preceded by a submodel calculation (the
same submodel) with
displacement interpolation and force output request. Summarizing, in order to
create a force-driven calculation of a submodel, knowing the displacement
results in the global model one would proceed as follows:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>perform a submodel calculation with displacement boundary conditions
  obtained by interpolation from the global model; request the output of the forces in the nodes on the boundary of the
  submodel in frd-format (let us call this file submodel.frd).
</LI>
<LI>repeat the submodel calculation but now with force boundary conditions obtained
  by interpolation from the previous submodel calculation (i.e. replace the
  global file in the submodel input deck by submodel.frd and the
  *BOUNDARY,SUBMODEL card by a *CLOAD,SUBMODEL card).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Applications of this technique include force-driven fracture mechanics calculations.

<P>
Finally, the OMEGA0 parameter (notice that the last character is the number
zero, not the letter O) specifies the value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1518.png"
 ALT="$ \omega_0$"></B></SPAN> in a
<A HREF="node309.html#green">*GREEN</A> step. It is a required parameter in a *GREEN step.

<P>
If more than one *CLOAD card occurs within the input deck the following rules apply:

<P>
If a *CLOAD card is applied to the same node AND in the same direction as in a
previous application, then

<UL>
<LI>if the previous application was in the same step the *CLOAD value is
  added, else it is replaced
</LI>
<LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude
</LI>
</UL>

<PRE>
Example:

*CLOAD,OP=NEW,AMPLITUDE=A1,TIME DELAY=20.
1000,3,10.3
</PRE>

<P>
removes all previous point load forces and applies a force with magnitude 10.3
and amplitude A1 (shifted in positive time direction by 20 time units) for degree of freedom three (global if no transformation was defined for node 1000, else local) of node 1000.
