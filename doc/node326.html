Keyword type: model definition

This option is used to tie two surfaces. It can only be used with 3-dimensional
elements (no plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric, beam or shell
elements). There is one required parameter NAME. Optional parameters are  
POSITION TOLERANCE, ADJUST, CYCLIC SYMMETRY,
MULTISTAGE, FLUID PERIODIC and FLUID CYCLIC. The last four parameters are
mutually exclusive. CYCLIC SYMMETRY and MULTISTAGE can only be used for
structures, FLUID PERIODIC and FLUID CYCLIC can only be used for 3D-fluid
calculations. The dependent surface is called the slave surface,
the independent surface is the master surface. The user can freely
decide which surface is taken as slave and which as master. The
surfaces are defined using <A HREF="node322.html#surface">*SURFACE</A>. Nodes belonging to the dependent surface cannot be used as
dependent nodes in other SPC's or MPC's. Only nodes on an axis of
cyclic symmetry can belong to both the slave as well as to the master
surface. 

<P>
Default (i.e. in the absense of the CYCLIC SYMMETRY, the MULTISTAGE, the FLUID
PERIODIC and FLUID CYCLIC
parameter) is a tie of two adjacent surfaces in a structural calculation. This is also called tied
contact. In that case MPC's are generated connecting the slave nodes with the
master faces, provided the orthogonal distance between the nodes and the adjacent face 
does not
exceed the POSITION TOLERANCE. If no tolerance is specified, or the tolerance is smaller than <B><IMG
 WIDTH="44" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img778.png"
 ALT="$ 10^{-10}$"></B>, a default tolerance applies equal to
<B><IMG
 WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1826.png"
 ALT="$ 2.5 \%$"></B> of the typical element size. In addition, the projection of the slave
node onto the master face must lie within this face or at any rate not farther away
(measured parallel to the face) than
the default tolerance just defined. For tied contact the slave surface can
be a nodal or element face surface, whereas the master surface has to consist
of element faces. Nodes which are not connected are stored in file
WarnNodeMissMasterIntersect.nam and can be read into CalculiX GraphiX by using
the command ``read WarnNodeMissMasterIntersect.nam inp''. Nodes which are
connected are automatically adjusted, i.e. the position of the slave nodes is
modified such that they lie exactly on the master surface, unless ADJUST=NO
was specified by the user. In order to create
the MPC's connecting the slave and master side, the latter is
triangulated. The triangulation is stored in file TriMasterContactTie.frd and
can be visualized using CalculiX GraphiX. 

<P>
The tie can be assigned a name by using the parameter NAME. This name can be
referred to on the  <A HREF="node237.html#cyclicsymmetrymodel">*CYCLIC
  SYMMETRY MODEL</A> card.

<P>
The parameter CYCLIC SYMMETRY is used to tie two surfaces bounding one and the
same datum sector in circumferential direction. Both the slave and the master
surface can be node or face based. For face based surfaces the nodes belonging
to the face are identied at the start of the algorithm which generates the
cyclic multiple point constraints.
For each slave node, a master node is determined which
matches the slave node within a tolerance specified by the parameter
POSITION TOLERANCE after rotation about the cyclic symmetry axis. The latter
rotation is an important aspect: for the purpose of generating cyclic symmetry
constraints distances are measured in
radial planes through the cyclic symmetry axis. Circumferential deviations do
NOT enter the calculation of this distance. A separate check, however,
verifying whether the geometry matches the number of sections defined by the
user, is performed. For details the reader is referred to <A HREF="node237.html#cyclicsymmetrymodel">*CYCLIC
  SYMMETRY MODEL</A>. If no tolerance is specified, or the tolerance is smaller than <B><IMG
 WIDTH="44" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1827.png"
 ALT="$ 10^{-30}$"></B>, a default tolerance is calculated equal to
<B><IMG
 WIDTH="44" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img778.png"
 ALT="$ 10^{-10}$"></B> times the distance of the master nodes to their closest
neighbor. Subsequently, a cyclic symmetry constraint is generated. If no master node is found within the tolerance, the face on the
master surface is identified to which the rotated slave node belongs, and a
more elaborate multiple point constraint is generated. If none
is found, the closest face is taken. If this face does not lie within <B><IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1828.png"
 ALT="$ 10 \%$"></B>
of its length from the slave node, no MPC's are generated for this node, an error is issued and the node is stored in
file WarnNodeMissCyclicSymmetry.nam. This file can be read into CalculiX GraphiX by using
the command ``read WarnNodeMissCyclicSymmetry.nam inp''.

<P>
The parameter MULTISTAGE is used to tie two coincident nodal surfaces (no
face based surfaces allowed) each of which
belongs to a different datum sector. In that way two axially neighboring datum
sectors can be tied. In this case, the order in which the user specifies the
surfaces is not relevant: the surface belonging to the smallest datum sector
is taken as master surface. The larger datum sector should not extend the
smaller datum sector by more than once the smaller datum sector, no matter in
what circumferential direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). This option
should not be used in the presence of network elements.

<P>
The parameter FLUID PERIODIC is used to define periodic conditions in 3D-fluid
calculations on surfaces
which are translated w.r.t. each other. The surfaces must be face-based and match. For
cyclic conditions in 3D-fluid calculations on surfaces which are rotated
w.r.t. each other the parameter FLUID CYCLIC is
used. Here too, the surfaces must be face-based and match. Both parameters require the
*CYCLIC SYMMETRY MODEL card to be effective. For 3D-fluid applications it is
recommended that at least three element rows separate the master and the slave surface.

<P>
The parameter NAME is needed if more than one *TIE constraint is defined. It
allows the user to distinguish the tie constraints when referring to them in
other keyword cards 
(e.g. <A HREF="node237.html#cyclicsymmetrymodel">*CYCLIC SYMMETRY MODEL</A>).

<P>
Notice that *TIE can only be used to tie ONE slave surface with ONE master
surface. It is not allowed to enter more than one line underneath the *TIE
card. Furthermore, *TIE cards must not use a name which has already been used
for another *TIE.
