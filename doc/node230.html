*CONTACT PAIR
</H2>

<P>
Keyword type: model definition

<P>
This option is used to express that two surfaces can make contact. There are
two required parameters: INTERACTION and TYPE, and two optional
parameters: SMALL SLIDING and ADJUST. The dependent surface is called the slave surface,
the independent surface is the master surface. 
Surfaces are defined using the <A HREF="node322.html#surface">*SURFACE</A> keyword card. The dependent
surface can be defined as a nodal surface (option TYPE=NODE on the *SURFACE
keyword) or as an element face surface (default for the *SURFACE card),
whereas the independent surface has to be defined as an element face
surface. If you are using quadratic elements, or if you select face-to-face
contact, however,
the slave surface has to be defined based on element faces and not on nodes.

<P>
If the master surface is made up of edges of axisymmetric elements make sure
that none of the edges contains nodes on the axis of symmetry. Indeed, such
edges are expanded into collapsed quadrilaterals the normals on which cannot
be determined in the usual way.  

<P>
The INTERACTION parameter takes the name of the surface interaction (keyword
<A HREF="node324.html#surfaceinteraction">*SURFACE INTERACTION</A>) which applies to the
contact pair. The surface interaction defines the nature of the contact
(hard versus soft contact..)

<P>
The TYPE parameter can take the value NODE TO SURFACE or SURFACE TO
SURFACE. NODE TO SURFACE triggers node-to-face penalty contact, SURFACE TO
SURFACE face-to-face penalty contact. Notice that although several *CONTACT
PAIR cards can be used within one and the same input deck, all must be of the
same type. It is not allowed to mix NODE TO SURFACE and SURFACE TO SURFACE
penalty contact within one and the same input deck.

<P>
The SMALL SLIDING parameter only applies to node-to-face penalty contact. If it is not active, the
contact is large sliding. This means that the pairing between the nodes
belonging to the dependent surface and faces of the independent surface is
performed anew in every iteration. If the SMALL SLIDING parameter is active,
the pairing is done once at the start of every increment and kept during the
complete increment. SMALL SLIDING usually converges better than LARGE SLIDING, since
changes in the pairing can deteriorate the convergence rate.

<P>
The ADJUST parameter allows the user to move selected slave nodes at
the start of the calculation (i.e. at the start of the first step) such that they make contact with the master
surface. This is a change of coordinates, i.e. the geometry of the structure
at the start of the calculation is changed. This can be helpful if due to
inaccuracies in the modeling a slave node which should lie on the master
surface at the start of the calculation actually does not. Especially in
static calculations this can lead to a failure to detect contact in the first
increment and large displacements (i.e. acceleration due to a failure to
establish equilibrium). These large displacements may jeopardize convergence in
any subsequent iteration. The ADJUST parameter can be used with a node set as
argument or with a nonnegative real number. If a node set is selected, all
nodes in the set are adjusted at the start of the calculation. If a real
number is specified, all nodes for which the clearance is smaller or equal to
this number are adjusted. Penetration is interpreted as a negative clearance
and consequently all penetrating nodes are always adjusted, no matter how
small the adjustment size (which must be nonnegative). Notice that large
adjustments can lead to deteriorated element quality. The adjustments are done
along a vector through the slave node and locally orthogonal to the master surface.

First line:

<UL>
<LI>*CONTACT PAIR
</LI>
<LI>enter the required parameter INTERACTION and any optional parameters.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Following line:

<UL>
<LI>Name of the slave surface (can be nodal or element face based).
</LI>
<LI>Name of the master surface (must be based on element faces).
</LI>
</UL>
Repeat this line if needed.

<P>
<PRE>
Example:

*CONTACT PAIR,INTERACTION=IN1,ADJUST=0.01
dep,ind
</PRE>

<P>
defines a contact pair consisting of the surface dep as dependent
surface and the element face surface ind as independent surface. The name of
the surface interaction is IN1. All slave nodes for which the clearance is
smaller than or equal to 0.01 will be moved onto the master surface.
