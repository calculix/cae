Theseinclude surface flux (energy per unit of surface per unit oftime) on element faces and volume flux in bodies (energy per unit ofvolume per unit of time). <P>In order to specify which face the flux is entering or leaving thefaces are numbered. The numbering depends on the element type.<P>For hexahedral elements the faces are numbered as follows (numbers arenode numbers):<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2-3-4</LI><LI>Face 2: 5-8-7-6</LI><LI>Face 3: 1-5-6-2</LI><LI>Face 4: 2-6-7-3</LI><LI>Face 5: 3-7-8-4</LI><LI>Face 6: 4-8-5-1</LI></UL><P>for tetrahedral elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2-3</LI><LI>Face 2: 1-4-2</LI><LI>Face 3: 2-4-3</LI><LI>Face 4: 3-4-1</LI></UL><P>for wedge elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2-3</LI><LI>Face 2: 4-5-6</LI><LI>Face 3: 1-2-5-4</LI><LI>Face 4: 2-3-6-5</LI><LI>Face 5: 3-1-4-6</LI></UL><P>for quadrilateral plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 2: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 3: 3-4</LI><LI>Face 4: 4-1</LI><LI>Face N: in negative normal direction (only for plane stress)</LI><LI>Face P: in positive normal direction (only for plane stress) </LI></UL><P>for triangular plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 2: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 3: 3-1</LI><LI>Face N: in negative normal direction (only for plane stress)</LI><LI>Face P: in positive normal direction (only for plane stress)</LI></UL><P>for quadrilateral shell elements:<UL><LI>Face NEG or 1: in negative normal direction</LI><LI>Face POS or 2: in positive normal direction</LI><LI>Face 3: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 4: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 5: 3-4</LI><LI>Face 6: 4-1</LI></UL><P>for triangular shell elements:<UL><LI>Face NEG or 1: in negative normal direction</LI><LI>Face POS or 2: in positive normal direction</LI><LI>Face 3: 1-2</LI><LI>Face 4: 2-3</LI><LI>Face 5: 3-1</LI></UL>The labels NEG and POS can only be used for uniform flux and are introducedfor compatibility with ABAQUS. Notice that the labels 1 and 2 correspond tothe brick face labels of the 3D expansion of the shell (Figure 73).<P>for beam elements:<UL><LI>Face 1: in negative 1-direction</LI><LI>Face 2: in positive 1-direction</LI><LI>Face 3: in positive 2-direction</LI><LI>Face 5: in negative 2-direction</LI></UL>The beam face numbers correspond to the brick face labels of the 3Dexpansion of the beam (Figure 78).<P>The surface flux is entered as a uniform flux with distributed fluxtype label Sx where x is the number of the face. For flux entering thebody the magnitude of the flux is positive, for flux leaving the bodyit is negative. If the flux is nonuniform the label takes the formSxNUy and a user subroutine dflux.f must be provided specifying thevalue of the flux. The label can be up to 20 characters long. Inparticular, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform fluxpatterns (maximum 16 characters).<P>For body generated flux (energy per unit of time per unit of volume) thedistributed flux type label is BF for uniform flux and BFNUy fornonuniform flux. For nonuniform flux the user subroutine dflux must beprovided. Here too, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform bodyflux patters (maximum 16 characters).<P>Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE and TIME DELAY. OP takes the value NEW or MOD.  OP=MOD is default and implies that the surface fluxes on different faces in previous steps are kept.  Specifying adistributed flux on a face for which such a flux was defined in aprevious step replaces this value, if a flux was defined for the same face within the same stepit is added. OP=NEW implies that all previoussurface flux is removed. If multiple *DFLUX cards are present in astep this parameter takes effect for the first *DFLUX card only. <P>The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitudeby which the flux values are scaled (mainly used for dynamiccalculations). Thus, in that case the values entered on the *DFLUXcard are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the(time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At theend of the step the reference value is replaced by the actual value atthat time. In subsequentsteps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or theamplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keepsits validity. The AMPLITUDE parameter has noeffect on nonuniform fluxes.<P>The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAYmust be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which theAMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. Forinstance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is takenwhich applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once onone and the same keyword card.<P>Notice that in case an element set is used on any line following *DFLUX thisset should not contain elements from more than one of the following groups:{plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric elements}, {beams, trusses},{shells, membranes}, {volumetric elements}.<P>In order to apply a distributed flux to a surface the element set labelunderneath may be replaced by a surface name. In that case the ``x'' in theflux type label takes the value zero.<P>If more than one *DFLUX card occurs within the input deck the following rules apply:<P>If a *DFLUX with label S1 up to S6 or BF isapplied to an element for which a *DFLUX with the SAME label wasalready applied before, then<UL><LI>if the previous application was in the same step the flux value is  added, else it is replaced</LI><LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude</LI></UL><P><P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*DFLUX</LI><LI>Enter any needed parameters and their value</LI></UL><P>Following line for surface flux:<UL><LI>Element number or element set label.</LI><LI>Distributed flux type label.</LI><LI>Actual magnitude of the load (power per unit of surface).</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P>Following line for body flux:<UL><LI>Element number or element set label.</LI><LI>Distributed flux type label (BF or BFNU).</LI><LI>Actual magnitude of the load (power per unit of volume).</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P><PRE>
