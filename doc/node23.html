Mesh refinement of a curved cantilever beam</A>
</H2>

<P>
This example illustrates the use of the *REFINE MESH keyword card in order to
refine a tetrahedral mesh based on some solution variable. The structure is a
curved cantilever beam (Figure <A HREF="#refine1">57</A>) meshed very coarsely using C3D10
elements. The left side of the beam is completely fixed in z-direction, the
lower left node is furthermore fixed in x and y, the lower right node in
y. A load of 9 force units is applied to the nodes in the right face of the
beam in +y direction. This leads to the normal stresses in z shown in the
Figure. The beam experiences bending leading to tensile stresses at the bottom
and compressive stresses at the top. The input deck of the beam (circ10p.inp)
is part of the CalculiX test suite.

SOF,SOM
*NODE FILE

*EL FILE
S
*REFINE MESH,LIMIT=50.
S
*END STEP
</PRE>

<P>
It illustrates several possibilities to obtain the reaction forces. One way is
to use the *NODE PRINT keyword card to request the storage of RF in the .dat
file. It acts on a node set, in this case all nodes on the left surface of the
beam. The parameter TOTALS=ONLY indicates that only the sum of the forces
should be printed, not the individual contributions. The *NODE PRINT option
works well if the adjacent elements of the nodal set are not subject to
distributed loads, neither surface distributed loads (pressure) nor volumetric
distribute loads (gravity, centrifugal forces). Else the value printed for RF
will include part of these latter forces. 

<P>
A second possibility is to define a facial surface and use SOF and SOM
underneath the *SECTION PRINT card in order to request the forces and moments
on this surface. The surface Sfix consists of all faces in the left surface of
the beam. The forces and moments are obtained by integration across the
surface.

<P>
The output in the .dat-file looks like:
<PRE>
 total force (fx,fy,fz) for set FIX and time  0.1000000E+01

       -9.372063E-13 -9.000000E+00  3.127276E-12

    6.000000E+00 -1.377949E+01  7.631875E+00
</PRE>

<P>
From this one observes that the reaction force obtained by the *NODE PRINT
statement is very accurate, however, the integration across the surface of the
stresses is rather inaccurate: instead of 9 force units one obtains 7.23
units. The moment about the center of gravity is 65.5 [force][length] instead
of the expected 72 [force][length] (the length of the beam is 8 length units).

<P>
The value of the error estimator is shown in Figure <A HREF="#refine2">58</A>. Not
surprisingly, the error is quite high, up to 30 %. 

<P>
In order to obtain better results, an automatic stress-based refinement is
triggered by the *REFINE MESH,LIMIT=50 card. The field on which the refinement
is based is listed underneath this card. &ldquo;S&rdquo; means that the Mises stress
will be used. The Mises stress for this example reaches values of about 400
stress units, so a refinement of up to a factor of 8 is locally possible (a
refinement limit of 50. was chosen). In the current version of CalculiX up to
three iterations are performed, each of which allows for a refinement by a
factor of two. The refinements are always applied to a version of the original
mesh in which any quadratic elements are replaced by linear ones (C3D10 by
C3D4), i.e. the middle nodes are not taken into account. The results of these
refinement iterations are stored as input decks (containing only the mesh) in
files finemesh.inp0, finemesh.inp1 and finemesh.inp2. After generating the
mesh stored in finemesh.inp2, the program generates midnodes for all elements
if the input deck contained at least one quadratic element. All nodes are
subsequently projected onto the faces of the original mesh. This means that
the geometry is basically described by the outer surface of the mesh in the
input deck. Elements in the input deck other than tetrahedral elements remain
untouched. The resulting projected mesh is stored as input deck in
jobname.fin. It contains only the refined mesh (nodes and elements).

<P>
Running the circ10p input deck and reapplying the necessary boundary and
loading conditions (this has to be done by hand) leads to the input deck
cric10pfin.inp (also part of the CalculiX test examples). Running this deck
leads to the normal z-stresses in Figure <A HREF="#refine3">59</A> and the error in Figure <A HREF="#refine4">60</A>.

<P>
The mesh has been refined near the left face of the beam, where the stresses
were highest. The resulting elements are quadatic elements and the curvature
of the original mesh has been nicely kept. 

<P>
The compressive stresses are slightly increased, while the tensile stresses
are now much more localized about the nodes fixed in y-direction. The overall
level, however, is similar. The stress error is about the same as for the
coarse mesh, however, at those locations where the stress is high, the error
is now low, about 5 % instead of 30 %. These are the locations of interest.

<P>
The output for the reaction forces in the .dat file looks like: 
<PRE>
 total force (fx,fy,fz) for set FIX and time  0.1000000E+01

        3.221013E-12 -9.000000E+00  7.356782E-12

    6.000000E+00  7.227514E-01  9.253863E+00
</PRE>

<P>
The nodal output is again very accurate, while the section output has clearly
improved: the total reaction force is now -9.25 force units, the moment about
the center of gravity is 72.12 [force][length]. The finer mesh leads to more
accurate nodal stresses, which are the ones which have been used to determined
the section forces.
