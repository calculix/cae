The corresponding degrees of freedom are:  <P>  <UL> <LI>total temperature: 0 </LI> <LI>mass flow: 1 </LI> <LI>total pressure: 2 </LI> </UL>  <P> The use of *NETWORK MPC requires the coding of subroutines networkmpc_lhs.f and networkmpc_rhs.f by the user. In these routines the user defines the MPC (linear or nonlinear) using the information entered underneath *NETWORK MPC. The syntax is identical to *EQUATION except for an additional parameter TYPE   specifying the type of MPC. Using this type the user can distinguish between   different kinds of MPC in the networkmpc_lhs.f and networkmpc_rhs.f subroutines.  <P> For instance, suppose the user wants to define a network MPC of the form:  <P> <P></P> <DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay"><!-- MATH  \begin{equation} f:=a p_{t} (node_1) + b p_t^2 (node_2)=0 \end{equation}  --> <TABLE CLASS="equation" CELLPADDING="0" WIDTH="100%" ALIGN="CENTER"> <TR VALIGN="MIDDLE"> <TD NOWRAP ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG  WIDTH="236" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"  SRC="img2334.png"  ALT="$\displaystyle f:=a p_{t} (node_1) + b p_t^2 (node_2)=0$"></SPAN></TD> <TD NOWRAP CLASS="eqno" WIDTH="10" ALIGN="RIGHT"> (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">756</SPAN>)</TD></TR> </TABLE></DIV> <BR CLEAR="ALL"><P></P>  <P> specifying that the total pressure in node 1 should be (-b/a) times the square of the total pressure in node 2. There are 2 degrees of freedom involved: dof 2 in node 1 and dof 2 in node 2. Underneath *NETWORK MPC the user defines the coefficients and degrees of freedom of the terms involved:  <P> <PRE>
*NETWORK MPC,TYPE=QUADRATIC
2
node1,2,a,node2,2,b
</PRE>  <P> All this information including the type of the MPC is transferred to the networkmpc_lhs.f and networkmpc_rhs.f subroutines. In networkmpc_rhs.f the user has to code the calculation of -f, in networkmpc_lhs.f the calculation of the derivative of f w.r.t. each degree of freedom occurring in the MPC. This has been done for TYPE=QUADRATIC and the reader is referred to the source code and example networkmpc.inp for further details.    <P>  </body></html>
