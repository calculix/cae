*DLOAD
</H2>

<P>
Keyword type: step

<P>
This option allows the specification of distributed loads. These include
constant pressure loading on element faces, edge loading on shells and mass loading (load per unit
mass) either by gravity forces or by centrifugal forces. 

<P>
For surface loading the faces of the elements are numbered as follows (for the
node numbering of the elements see Section 3.1):

<P>
for hexahedral elements:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>face 1: 1-2-3-4
</LI>
<LI>face 2: 5-8-7-6
</LI>
<LI>face 3: 1-5-6-2
</LI>
<LI>face 4: 2-6-7-3
</LI>
<LI>face 5: 3-7-8-4
</LI>
<LI>face 6: 4-8-5-1
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for tetrahedral elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: 1-2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: 1-4-2
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 2-4-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 4: 3-4-1
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for wedge elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: 1-2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: 4-5-6
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 1-2-5-4
</LI>
<LI>Face 4: 2-3-6-5
</LI>
<LI>Face 5: 3-1-4-6
</LI>
</UL>
for quadrilateral plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: 1-2
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: 2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 3-4
</LI>
<LI>Face 4: 4-1
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for triangular plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: 1-2
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: 2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 3-1
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for beam elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: pressure in 1-direction
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: pressure in 2-direction
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For shell elements no face number is needed since there is only one kind of loading:
pressure in the direction of the normal on the shell. 

<P>
The surface loading is entered as a uniform pressure with distributed
load type label Px where x is the number of the face. Thus, for
pressure loading the magnitude of the load is positive, for tension
loading it is negative. For nonuniform pressure the label takes the
form PxNUy, and the user subroutine <A HREF="node346.html#userdload">dload.f</A> must be provided. The label can be up to 20 characters long. In
particular, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform loading
patterns (maximum 16 characters). A typical
example of a nonuniform loading is the hydrostatic pressure. Another option is to assign the pressure of a fluid node to an element
side. In that case the label takes the form PxNP, where NP stands for network
pressure. The fluid node must be an corner node of a network element. Instead of a
concrete pressure value the user must provide the fluid node number.

<P>
Edge loading is only provided for shell elements. Its units are force per unit
length. The label is EDNORx where x can take a value between one and three for
triangular shells and between one and four for quadrilateral shells. This type
of loading is locally orthogonal to the edge. Internally, it is replaced by a
pressure load, since shell elements in CalculiX are expanded into volumetric elements. The
numbering is as follows:

<P>
for triangular shell elements:

<UL>
<LI>Edge 1: 1-2
</LI>
<LI>Edge 2: 2-3
</LI>
<LI>Edge 3: 3-1
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for quadrilateral shell elements:

<UL>
<LI>Edge 1: 1-2
</LI>
<LI>Edge 2: 2-3
</LI>
<LI>Edge 3: 3-4
</LI>
<LI>Edge 4: 4-1
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For centrifugal loading (label CENTRIF) the rotational speed square (<B><IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1573.png"
 ALT="$ \omega^2$"></B>) and two
points on the rotation axis are required, for gravity loading with known
gravity vector (label GRAV) the size and direction of the gravity vector are to be
given. Whereas more than one centrifugal load for one and the same set is not
allowed, several gravity loads can be defined, provided the direction of the
load varies. If the gravity vector is not known it can be calculated based on the
momentaneous mass distribution of the system (label NEWTON). This requires the
value of the Newton gravity constant by means of a <A HREF="node300.html#physicalconstants">*PHYSICAL
  CONSTANTS</A> card.

<P>
The limit of one centrifugal load per set does not apply to linear dynamic
(<A HREF="node285.html#modaldynamic">*MODAL DYNAMIC</A>) and steady state (<A HREF="node317.html#steadystatedynamics">*STEADY
  STATE DYNAMICS</A>) calculations. Here, the limit is two. In this way a
rotating eccentricity can be modeled. Prerequisite for the centrifugal loads to
be interpreted as distinct is the choice of distinct rotation axes.

<P>
Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, LOAD CASE and SECTOR. OP takes the value NEW or
MOD. OP=MOD is default. For surface loads it 
implies that the loads on different faces are kept from the previous step. Specifying a
distributed load on a face for which such a load was defined in a
previous step replaces this value, if a load was defined on the same face
within the same step it is added. OP=NEW implies that all previous
surface loading is removed. For mass loading the effect is similar. If multiple *DLOAD cards are present in a
step this parameter takes effect for the first *DLOAD card only. 

<P>
The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitude
by which the force values are scaled (mainly used for dynamic
calculations). Thus, in that case the values entered on the *DLOAD
card are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the
(time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At the
end of the step the reference value is replaced by the actual value at
that time. In subsequent
steps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or the
amplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keeps
its validity. For nonuniform loading the
AMPLITUDE parameter has no effect.

<P>
The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAY
must be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which the
AMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. For
instance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is taken
which applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once on
one and the same keyword card.

<P>
The LOAD CASE parameter is only active in <A HREF="node317.html#steadystatedynamics">*STEADY STATE
 DYNAMICS</A> calculations with harmonic loading. LOAD CASE = 1 means that the
 loading is real or in-phase.  LOAD CASE = 2 indicates that the load is
 imaginary or equivalently phase-shifted by <B><IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img570.png"
 ALT="$ 90 ^\circ$"></B>. Default is LOAD CASE =
 1. 

<P>
The SECTOR parameter can only be used in <A HREF="node285.html#modaldynamic">*MODAL
DYNAMIC</A> and <A HREF="node317.html#steadystatedynamics">*STEADY STATE
DYNAMICS</A> calculations with cyclic symmetry. The datum
sector (the sector which is modeled) is sector 1. The other sectors are
numbered in increasing order in the rotational direction going from the slave
surface to the master surface as specified by the <A HREF="node326.html#tie">*TIE</A>
card. Consequently, the SECTOR parameters allows to apply a distributed load to any
element face in any sector.

<P>
Notice that in case an element set is used on any line following *DLOAD this
set should not contain elements from more than one of the following groups:
{plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric elements}, {beams, trusses},
{shells, membranes}, {volumetric elements}.

<P>
If more than one *DLOAD card occurs within the input deck, or a *DLOAD and at
least one
*DSLOAD card, the following rules apply:

<P>
If a *DLOAD or *DSLOAD with label P1 up to P6 or EDNOR1 up to EDNOR4 or BF is
applied to an element for which a *DLOAD or *DSLOAD with the SAME label was
already applied before, then

<UL>
<LI>if the previous application was in the same step the load value is
  added, else it is replaced
</LI>
<LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If a *DLOAD with label CENTRIF is applied to the same set AND with the same 
rotation axis as in a previous application, then

<UL>
<LI>If the prevous application was in the same step, the CENTRIF value is 
added, else it is replaced
</LI>
<LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If a *DLOAD with label GRAV is applied to the same set AND with the same 
gravity direction vector as in a previous application, then

<UL>
<LI>If the prevous application was in the same step, the GRAV value is 
added, else it is replaced
</LI>
<LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude
