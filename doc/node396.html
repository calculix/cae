<P>
Contact is triggered by the keyword card <A HREF="node230.html#contactpair">*CONTACT
 PAIR</A>. It defines an interaction between a nodal or element face
slave surface and a element face 
 master surface. The master surface is triangulated using standard
 triangulation schemes for the different kind of faces (3-node, 4-node,
 6-node or 8-node). This is done in subroutines allocont.f, 
 triangucont.f and trianeighbor.f. This triangulation is a topological one and does not depend
 on the concrete coordinates. It is performed at the start of nonlingeo.c. The
 resulting triangles are stored in field koncont (Figure <A HREF="#contactedges">163</A>): for triangle i the locations
 koncont(1..3,i) contain the nodes belonging to the triangle, koncont(4,i)
 contains the element face to which the triangle belongs. The element face is
 characterized by a code consisting of 10*(element number)+face number. So the
 code for face 4 of element 33 is 334. The triangles are stored in the order
 of the contact tie constraints they belong to. For tie constraint i the
 location of the first triangle in field koncont is given by itietri(1,i), the
 location of the last one by itietri(2,i). 

<P>
The triangulation of the master surfaces allows for fast algorithms to
determine the master face opposite of a given slave node. To facilitate this
search, a field imastop is created: imastop(i,j) yields for triangle j the
triangle opposite of node koncont(i,j). This is the neighboring triangle
containing the edge to which node koncont(i,j) does not belong. This adjacency
information is needed to apply the search algorithms in Section 1.7 of
[<A
 HREF="node448.html#George">24</A>]. To facilitate the construction of imastop (done in subroutine
trianeighbor.f), the edges of the triangulation are catalogued by use of two
auxiliary fields ipe(*) and ime(4,*). An edge is characterized by two nodes i
and j, suppose <B><IMG
 WIDTH="451" HEIGHT="814" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1914.png"
 ALT="$ i&lt;j$"></B>. Then, if no other edge was encountered so far for which
i was the lowest node, the present edge is stored in ime(1..4,ipe(i)), where
ime(1,ipe(i)) contains j, ime(2,ipe(i)) contains one of the triangles to which
the edge belongs, e.g. t1, ime(3,ipe(i)) contains the local position in
koncont(1..3,t1) of the node belonging to t1 but not on the edge i-j and
ime(4,ipe(i)) is a pointer to ime(1..4,ime(4,ipe(i))) containing any other edge for which i is the lowest node
number, else it is zero. 'For node-to-face penalty contact these auxiliary fields are deleted upon leaving
trianeighbor. For face-to-face contact they are further used in slavintmortar.f.

<P>
For further calculations both the slave nodes and the slave surfaces have to
be catalogued. In case the slave surface is defined by
nodes, the corresponding faces have to be found. To this end, all external
faces of the structure are catalogued by fields ipoface and nodface in
subroutine findsurface.f (Figure <A HREF="#contactn2fipoface">164</A>). Assuming
face f1 to contain corner nodes <B><IMG

The slave nodes are stored in field islavnode(*) (Figure <A HREF="#contactislavnode">165</A>), tie per tie and sorted in

in islavnode before the first slave node of tie i. If ntie is the number of
ties, nslavnode contains ntie+1 entries, in order to mark the end of the field
islavnode as well. The total number of slave nodes is denoted by nslavs. For
face-to-face contact the field clearslavnode contains the difference between
the clearance specified by the user with the keyword card *CLEARANCE and the
clearance calculated based on the actual coordinates. This field is zero in
the absence of the *CLEARANCE card. The field clearini contains the clearance
for each node belonging to the slave face at stake. This information is copied
from field clearslavnode.

The slave faces are stored in islavsurf(1..2,*) (Figure
<A HREF="#contactn2fislavsurf">166</A> and Figure <A HREF="#contactf2fislavsurf">167</A>). islavsurf(1,*) contains the
slave faces, tie per tie (not in any way sorted), whereas islavsurf(2,*) is an
auxiliary field not further needed for node-to-face contact. itiefac(1,i) is a pointer into field
islavsurf marking the first face for tie i, itiefac(2,i) points to the last
face. The total number of slave faces is ifacecount. The area of the slave
faces is stored in a corresponding field areaslav. For face-to-face contact
the second column of islavsurf is used as a pointer to locations in field
pslavsurf, preceding the integration points in the face (local coordinates and
weights). If for a given integration point in the slave face an opposite
master face is found, the local coordinates, the label of the master face and
the local normal to the master face are stored in field pmastsurf.

For the purpose of calculating the area corresponding to a given slave node,

iponoels(i) points towards an entry inoels(1..3,iponoels(i)) containing the
position within field islavsurf(1,*) of a face to which node i belongs and an entry inoels(2,iponoels(i))  pointing to any other
faces to which node i belongs. Field xnoels contains the weight of the node
within the face. This information is
gathered in subroutine inicont.c.

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
The master nodes are catalogued in field imastnode in the sane way that the
slave nodes are stored in islavnode (Figure <A HREF="#contactimastnode">169</A>). The
master nodes are stored tie per tie, within each tie they are sorted in
ascending order. For tie i nmastnode(i) points towards the location in
imastnode immediately before the master node with the smallest number within
tie i, nmastnode(i) points towards the master node within tie i with the
largest number. The size of imastnode is nmastnode(ntie+1), where ntie is the
number of ties. In each iteration and/or increment the topological information
of each master triangle is complemented by geometrical information consisting
of the center of gravity (in field cg) and the equations of the triangle plane
and the planes quasi-perpendicular to the triangle and containing its edges. For triangle i the coordinates of the
center of gravity are stored in cg(1..3,i). The coefficients of the equation
of the plane orthogonal to the triangle and containing the first edge are
stored in straight(1..4,i). The first edge is defined as the edge through
nodes koncont(1,i) and koncont(2,i). Similar for edge 2 (straight(5..8,i)) and
edge 3 (straight(9..12,i)). The
coefficients of the triangle plane are stored in straight(13..16,i). The
geometrical information is calculated in routine updatecontpen.f. The planes
bordering the triangles are quasi-orthogonal to the triangle in the sense that
they are in-between the truly orthogonal planes and the planes through the
triangle edges and orthogonal to the neighboring triangles. To this end the
mean normals are stored in field xmastnor(3,*) (Figure <A HREF="#contactimastnode">169</A>).

<P>
Further geometrical information is the area of each slave face i, stored in
areaslav(i), the area corresponding to slave node i, stored in springarea(1,i)
and the penetration at the start of each step in slave node i (<B><IMG
 WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="679" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1922.png"
 ALT="$ &lt; 0$"></B> if any
penetration , else 0), stored in springarea(2,i). These calculations are
performed each time gencontelem_n2f.f or gencontelem_f2f.f is called.

<P>
Subsequently, contact spring elements are generated (routine
gencontelem.f). To this end, each node belonging to the dependent contact
slave surface is treated separately. To determine the master surface the node
interacts with, a triangle belonging to the triangulation of the
corresponding master surface are identified, such that its center of
gravity is closest to the dependent node. Then, a triangle is identified
by adjacency, such that the orthogonal projection of the slave node is
contained in this triangle. If such a triangle is found, a contact spring element is generated
consisting of the dependent node and the independent surface the triangle
belongs to, provided the node penetrates the structure or the clearance does
not exceed a given margin. Before checking the penetration or clearance an
adjustment of the geometry is performed in case the user has activated the ADJUST
parameter. If any of these conditions is not satisfied, no contact spring element is generated for this dependent
node and the next node is treated. The sole purpose of the triangulation of the
master surface is the fast identification of the independent face a dependent
node interacts with. 

<P>
The stiffness matrix of the contact spring elements is calculated in
springstiff.f, called by mafillsm.f. In order to determine the
stiffness matrix the local coordinates of the projection of the dependent node
onto the independent surface are needed. This is performed in attach.f. Use is
made of a cascaded regular grid to determine the location within the
independent surface which is closest to the dependent node. The local
coordinates are needed to determine the shape functions and their derivatives.
The contact force is determined in springforc.f, called by
results.f. Here too, routine attach.f is called.

<P>
Since the geometrical information is recalculated in every iteration, large
deformations are taken into account, unless the user has specified SMALL
SLIDING in which case the geometry update takes place once at the start of
each new increment.

<P>
The material properties of the contact spring, defined by means of
the *SURFACE INTERACTION, the *SURFACE BEHAVIOR and the *FRICTION card, are stored in the same
fields as the *MATERIAL and *ELASTIC,TYPE=ISOTROPIC card. 

<P>
The general structure of the contact algorithms for nonlinear geometric
calculations is as follows. The contact topology is determined in
inicont.c. This routine is called once at the start of a new step and calls
the following routines:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>allocont: determining the number of master triangles and slave entities
  (nodes or faces, depending on whether the slave surface is nodal or facial)
</LI>
<LI>triangucont: triangulation of the master side
</LI>
<LI>trianeighbor: determining the triangle neighbors in the triangulation of
  the master side
</LI>
<LI>findsurface (only for node-to-face contact): catalogueing the external faces and creating the fields
  ipoface and nodface
</LI>
<LI>tiefaccont: determinnig the field islavsurf and itieface (slave nodes),
  islavnode and nslavnode (slave faces), iponoels, xnoels and inoels (only for
  node-to-face contact) and imastnode and nmastnode (master nodes).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For face-to-face contact the routine precontact.c is called at the start of
each new increment. Its purpose is:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to calculate the center of gravity and the quasi-orthogonal planes to
  the master triangles (updatecontpen.f).
</LI>
<LI>to calculate the clearance (if the *CLEARANCE keyword card is used)
  and/or adjust the slave nodes (if the ADJUST parameter is used on the
  *CONTACT PAIR card) at the start of the first step (adjustcontactnodes.f).
</LI>
<LI>to determine the location of the integration points in the slave faces
  based on the matching of the slave and the master faces (slavintpoints.f).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Furthermore, for face-to-face contact the routine interpolatestate is called
at the start of each new increment. It interpolates the state variables
(internal variables such as the slip accumulated so far) from the integration
points at the end of the previous increment, if any, to the new integration
points determined in slavintpoints.f. Indeed, at the start of a new increment
the matching between the slave and master surfaces is done anew and usually
leads to a change in the location of the integration points.

<P>
For contact with friction there are 9 internal variables (state
variables). They are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>1-3: the slip vector
</LI>
<LI>4-6: the relative displacement between slave and master surface
</LI>
<LI>7-9: the relative tangential displacement between slave and master
  surface
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
All of them are stored in global Carthesian coordinates.

<P>
The contact.c routine is called once per iteration. This applies to
node-to-face as well as face-to-face contact. For node-to-face contact the
purpose of contact.c is:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to update the center of gravity and the quasi-orthogonal planes of the
  master triangles (updatecontpen.f).
</LI>
<LI>to generate contact spring elements at those slave nodes for which the
  clearance does not exceed a predefined value <B><IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img763.png"
 ALT="$ c_0$"></B>
  (gencontelem_n2f.f). Additionally, gencontelem_2nf performs the
  calculation of:

<UL>
<LI>the area of all slave faces (stored in areaslav).
</LI>
<LI>the area corresponding to each slave node and the overlap at the start
  of the first step (stored in springarea).
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If a spring element is generated, its topology is stored in field kon in
accordance to Figure <A HREF="#contactn2fkon">170</A>. The parameter igauss is needed to
identify the area and overlap.

<P>
For face-to-face contact contact.c only calls routine gencontelem_f2f. At the
start of a new increment the field pmastsurf is filled for those slave
integration points for which an opposite master face is found. It contains the
local coordinates of the master face, its label (10*element+local face number)
and the local normals. Furthermore, field springarea is filled containing the
corresponding slave area and the overlap at the start of each increment in the
first step. Please note that pmastsurf and springarea are calculated at the
start of an increment and kept constant for all iterations across the complete
increment. The contact spring elements, however, are generated anew in each
iteration based on the sign of the clearance. A contact element is generated
only if the clearance is negative (i.e. in case of penetration). The topology
of the spring element is stored in field kon (Figure <A HREF="#contactf2fkon">171</A>) and contains the total number of
nodes (slave+master), the master nodes, the slave nodes, the address of the
integration point in  pslavsurf and the address of the slave face in
islavsurf.

<P>
Contact properties (*SURFACE BEHAVIOR, *FRICTION, *CONTACT DAMPING, *GAP HEAT
GENERATION) are preceded by a *SURFACE INTERACTION card and are internally treated as
material properties, i.e. the *SURFACE INTERACTION card is treated in the same
way as a *MATERIAL card. All data are stored in the elastic field elcon,
except for the tabular pressure-overclosure data, which are stored in the
isotropic hardening field plicon, and the gap conductance data, which are
stored in the kinematic hardening field plkcon. The contact properties in
elcon are stored in the order of Table <A HREF="#contactdata">20</A> for exponential,
linear, tabular and tied pressure-overclosure behavior.
