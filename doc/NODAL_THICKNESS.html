There are no parameters. This keyword only makes sense for nodes belonging to plane stress/strain elements,  shell elements and beam elements. For all of these except for the beam elements one thickness value should be given. For plane stress/strain and shell elements this is the thickness in normal direction. The normal direction can be defined by using the *NORMAL keyword card. If none is defined, the normal is calculated based on the geometrical data. For beam elements two thicknesses can be defined: one in 1-direction and one in 2-direction. The 1-direction can be defined on the *BEAM SECTION card, the 2-direction by the *NORMAL card.   <P> The *NODAL THICKNESS card takes precedence over any other thickness definitions if the NODAL THICKNESS parameter was selected on the *BEAM SECTION,  *SHELL SECTION  or *SOLID SECTION card. Right now, it cannot be used for composite materials.  <P> For structures in which axisymmetric elements (type CAX*) are present any thickness defined on the present card for plane stress/strain and shell elements applies to 360<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG  WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"  SRC="img315.png"  ALT="$ ^\circ$"></B></SPAN>.  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*NODAL THICKNESS </LI> </UL>  <P> Following line:  <UL> <LI>Node or set of nodes previously defined </LI> <LI>Thickness 1 </LI> <LI>Thickness 2 </LI> </UL>  <P> <PRE>

*NODAL THICKNESS
22,0.05,0.08
</PRE>  <P> assigns to node 22 the thickness 0.05 and 0.08. Any plane stress or shell element containing node 22 will have a local thickness of 0.05 unit lengths at node 22. Any beam element containing node 22 will have a thickness of 0.05 unit length in local 1-direction and a thickness of 0.08 unit length in local 2-direction.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: shell1.  <P>  </body></html>
