<B><IMG
 WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$ \epsilon=1$"></B>. In CalculiX, the radiation is
assumed to be diffuse (it does not depend on the angle under which it
is emitted from the surface) and gray (it does not depend on the
wavelength of the radiation). Selecting radiation type flux requires
the inclusion of the *PHYSICAL CONSTANTS card, which specifies the
value of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and the value of absolute zero in the user's units.
In order to specify which face the flux is entering or leaving the
faces are numbered. The numbering depends on the element type.

<P>
For hexahedral elements the faces are numbered as follows (numbers are
node numbers):

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: 1-2-3-4
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: 5-8-7-6
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 1-5-6-2
</LI>
<LI>Face 4: 2-6-7-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 5: 3-7-8-4
</LI>
<LI>Face 6: 4-8-5-1
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for tetrahedral elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: 1-2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: 1-4-2
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 2-4-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 4: 3-4-1
</LI>
</UL>
and for wedge elements:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: 1-2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: 4-5-6
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 1-2-5-4
</LI>
<LI>Face 4: 2-3-6-5
</LI>
<LI>Face 5: 3-1-4-6
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for quadrilateral plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: 1-2
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: 2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 3-4
</LI>
<LI>Face 4: 4-1
</LI>
<LI>Face N: in negative normal direction (only for plane stress)
</LI>
<LI>Face P: in positive normal direction (only for plane stress) 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for triangular plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: 1-2
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: 2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 3-1
</LI>
<LI>Face N: in negative normal direction (only for plane stress)
</LI>
<LI>Face P: in positive normal direction (only for plane stress) 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for quadrilateral shell elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face NEG or 1: in negative normal direction
</LI>
<LI>Face POS or 2: in positive normal direction
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 1-2
</LI>
<LI>Face 4: 2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 5: 3-4
</LI>
<LI>Face 6: 4-1
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
for triangular shell elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face NEG or 1: in negative normal direction
</LI>
<LI>Face POS or 2: in positive normal direction
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: 1-2
</LI>
<LI>Face 4: 2-3
</LI>
<LI>Face 5: 3-1
</LI>
</UL>
The labels NEG and POS can only be used for uniform, non-cavity radiation and are introduced
for compatibility with ABAQUS. Notice that the labels 1 and 2 correspond to
the brick face labels of the 3D expansion of the shell (Figure <A HREF="node40.html#2dexpansion">73</A>).

<P>
for beam elements:

<UL>
<LI>Face 1: in negative 1-direction
</LI>
<LI>Face 2: in positive 1-direction
</LI>
<LI>Face 3: in positive 2-direction
</LI>
<LI>Face 5: in negative 2-direction
</LI>
</UL>
The beam face numbers correspond to the brick face labels of the 3D
expansion of the beam (Figure <A HREF="node59.html#c1d">78</A>).

<P>
Radiation flux characterized by a uniform emissivity is entered by
the distributed flux 
type label Rx where x is the number of the face, followed by the sink
temperature and the emissivity. If the emissivity is nonuniform the
label takes the form  
RxNUy and a user subroutine <A HREF="node349.html#userradiate">radiate.f</A> must be provided specifying the
value of the emissivity and the sink temperature.  The label can be up to 17 characters long. In
particular, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform emissivity
patterns (maximum 13 characters).

<P>
If the user does not know
the sink temperature but rather prefers it to be calculated from the radiation
from other surfaces, the distributed flux type label RxCR should be used (CR
stands for cavity radiation). In that case, the temperature immediately
following the label is considered
as environment temperature for viewfactors smaller than 1, what is lacking to
reach the value of one is considered to radiate towards the
environment. Sometimes, it is useful to specify that the radiation is
closed. This is done by specifying a value of the environment temperature which is
negative if expressed on the absolute scale (Kelvin). Then, the viewfactors
are scaled to one exactly. For cavity radiation the
sink temperature is calculated based on the interaction of the surface at
stake with all other cavity radiation surfaces (i.e. with label RyCR, y taking
a value between 1 and 6). Surfaces for which no cavity radiation label is
specified are not used in the calculation of the viewfactor and radiation
flux. Therefore, it is generally desirable to specify cavity radiation
conditions on ALL element faces (or on none). If the emissivity is nonuniform,
the label reads RxCRNUy and a subroutine radiate.f specifying the emissivity
must be provided. The label can be up to 17 characters long. In
particular, y can be used to distinguish different nonuniform emissivity
patterns (maximum 11 characters). 

<P>
Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, RADIATION AMPLITUDE,
RADIATION TIME DELAY, ENVNODE and CAVITY. OP takes the value NEW or MOD. OP=MOD is default and
implies that the radiation fluxes on different faces are kept over all
steps starting from the last perturbation step. Specifying a
radiation flux on a face for which such a flux was defined in a
previous step replaces this value. OP=NEW implies that all previous
radiation flux is removed. If multiple *RADIATE cards are present in a
step this parameter takes effect for the first *RADIATE card only. 

<P>
The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitude
by which the sink temperature is scaled (mainly used for dynamic
calculations). Thus, in that case the sink temperature values entered
on the *RADIATE 
card are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the
(time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At the
end of the step the reference value is replaced by the actual value at
that time. In subsequent
steps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or the
amplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keeps
its validity. The AMPLITUDE parameter has no
effect on nonuniform fluxes and cavity radiation.

<P>
The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAY
must be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which the
AMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. For
instance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is taken
which applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once on
one and the same keyword card.

<P>
The RADIATION AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitude
by which the emissivity is scaled (mainly used for dynamic
calculations). Thus, in that case the emissivity values entered on the *RADIATE
card are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the
(time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At the
end of the step the reference value is replaced by the actual value at
that time. In subsequent
steps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or the
amplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keeps
its validity. The RADIATION AMPLITUDE parameter has no
effect on nonuniform fluxes.

<P>
The RADIATION TIME DELAY parameter modifies the RADIATION AMPLITUDE
parameter. As such, RADIATION TIME DELAY
must be preceded by an RADIATION AMPLITUDE name. RADIATION TIME DELAY is a time shift by which the
RADIATION AMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. For
instance, a RADIATION TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is taken
which applies to time t-10. The RADIATION TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once on
one and the same keyword card.

<P>
The ENVNODE option applies for uniform radiation conditions only and allows
the user to specify a sink node instead of a sink temperature. In that case,
the sink temperature is defined as the temperature of the sink node. 

<P>
Finally, the CAVITY parameter can be used to separate closed cavities. For the
calculation of the viewfactors for a specific face, only those faces are
considered which:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>are subject to cavity radiation
</LI>
<LI>belong to the same cavity.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The name of the cavity can consist of maximum 3 characters (including
numbers). Default cavity is '   ' (empty name). Since the calculation of the
viewfactors is approximate, it can happen that, even if a cavity is
mathematically closed, radiation comes in from outside. To prevent this, one
can define the faces of the cavity as belonging to one and the same cavity,
distinct from the cavities other faces belong to.

<P>
Notice that in case an element set is used on any line following *RADIATE this
set should not contain elements from more than one of the following groups:
{plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric elements}, {beams, trusses},
{shells, membranes}, {volumetric elements}.

<P>
In order to apply radiation conditions to a surface the element set label
underneath may be replaced by a surface name. In that case the ``x'' in the
radiation flux type label takes the value zero.

<P>
If more than one *RADIATE card occurs in the input deck the following rules
apply: if a *RADIATE applies to the same node and the same face as in a
previous application then the prevous value and previous amplitude (including
radiation amplitude) are replaced.
