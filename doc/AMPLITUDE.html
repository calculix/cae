The amplitude history should be given in pairs, each pair consisting of a value of the reference time and the corresponding value of the amplitude or by user subroutine uamplitude.f.   <P> There are four optional parameters TIME, USER, SHIFTX and SHIFTY and one required parameter NAME.If the parameter TIME=TOTAL TIME is used the reference time is the total time since the start of the calculation, else it is the local step time. Use as many pairs as needed, maximum four per line.   <P> The parameter USER indicates that the amplitude history versus time was implemented in user subroutine uamplitude.f. No pair data is required.   <P> With the parameters SHIFTX and SHIFTY the reference time and the amplitude of the (time,amplitude) pairs can be shifted by a fixed amount.  <P> The parameter NAME, specifying a name for the amplitude so that it can be used in loading definitions (*BOUNDARY, *CLOAD, *DLOAD and *TEMPERATURE) is required (maximum 80 characters).  <P> In each step, the local step time starts at zero. Its upper limit is given by the time period of the step. This time period is specified on the *STATIC, *DYNAMIC or *MODAL DYNAMIC keyword card. The default step time period is 1.   <P> In *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS steps the time is replaced by frequency, i.e. the *AMPLITUDE is interpreted as amplitude versus frequency (in cycles/time).   <P> The total time is the time accumulated until the beginning of the actual step augmented by the local step time. In *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS procedures total time coincides with frequency (in cycles/time).  <P> The loading values specified in the loading definitions (*BOUNDARY, *CLOAD, *DLOAD and *TEMPERATURE) are reference values. If an amplitude is selected in a loading definition, the actual load value is obtained by multiplying the reference value with the amplitude for the actual (local step or total) time. If no amplitude is specified, the actual load value depends on the procedure: for a *STATIC procedure, ramp loading is assumed connecting the load value at the end of the previous step (0 if there was none) to the reference value at the end of the present step in a linear way. For *DYNAMIC and *MODAL DYNAMIC procedures, step loading is assumed, i.e. the actual load equals the reference load for all time instances within the step. Reference loads which are not changed in a new step remain active, their amplitude description, however, becomes void, unless the TIME=TOTAL TIME parameter is activated. Beware that at the end of a step, all reference values for which an amplitude was specified are replaced by their actual values at that time.  <P> Notice that no different amplitude definitions are allowed on different degrees of freedom in one and the same node if a non-global coordinate system applied to that node. For instance, if you define a cylindrical coordinate system for a node, the amplitude for a force in radial direction has to be the same as for the tangential and axial direction.  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*AMPLITUDE </LI> <LI>Enter the required parameter. </LI> </UL>  <P> Following line, using as many entries as needed (unless the parameter USER was selected):  <UL> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Amplitude. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Amplitude. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Amplitude. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Amplitude. </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if more than eight entries (four data points) are needed.  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*AMPLITUDE,NAME=A1
0.,0.,10.,1.
</PRE>  <P> defines an amplitude function with name A1 taking the value 0. at t=0. and the value 1. at t=10. The time used is the local step time.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: beamdy1, beamnldy.  <P>  </body></html>
