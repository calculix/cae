The parameter ELSET containing the name of the set is required (maximum 80 characters), whereas the parameter GENERATE (without value) is optional. If present, element ranges can be expressed by their initial value, their final value, and an increment. If a set with the same name already exists, it is reopened and complemented. The name of a set is case insensitive. Internally, it is modified into upper case and a 'E' is appended to denote it as element set.  <P> The following names are reserved (i.e. cannot be used by the user for other purposes than those for which they are reserved):  <UL> <LI>FLUIDBLOCK: for block CFD-calculations </LI> </UL>  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*ELSET </LI> <LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values. </LI> </UL>  <P> Following line if the GENERATE parameter is omitted:  <UL> <LI>List of elements and/or sets of elements previously defined to be assigned to this element set (maximum 16 entries per line). </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed.  <P> Following line if the GENERATE parameter is included:  <UL> <LI>First element in set. </LI> <LI>Last element in set. </LI> <LI>Increment in element numbers between elements in the set. Default is 1. </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed.  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*ELSET,ELSET=E1,GENERATE
20,25
*ELSET,ELSET=E2
E1,50,51
</PRE>  <P> assigns the elements with numbers 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 to element set E1 and the elements with numbers 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (= set E1), 50 and 51 to element set E2.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: segment, beampo1, beampset.  <P> </body></html>
