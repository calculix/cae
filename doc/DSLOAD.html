Underneath the *DSLOAD card faces are listedfor which a section stress will be calculated by interpolation from the globalmodel. To this end these faces have to be part of a *SUBMODEL card,TYPE=SURFACE. The latter card also lists the name of the global model resultsfile.  <P>In case the globalcalculation was a *STATIC calculation the STEP parameter specifies the step in the global modelwhich will be used for the interpolation. If results for more than oneincrement within the step are stored, the last increment is taken. <P>In case the global calculation was a *FREQUENCY calculation the DATA SET parameterspecifies the mode in the global model which will be used for theinterpolation. It is the number preceding the string MODAL in the .frd-fileand it corresponds to the dataset number if viewing the .frd-file withCalculiX GraphiX.  Notice that the global frequency calculation is not allowedto contain preloading nor cyclic symmetry.<P>The distributed load type label convention is the same as for the*DLOAD card. Notice that <P><UL><LI>the section stresses are applied atonce at the start of the step, no matter the kind of procedure the user hasselected. For instance, the loads in a *STATIC procedure areusually ramped during the step. This is not the case of the section stresses.</LI><LI>the section stresses are interpolated from the stress values at the  nodes of the global model. These latter stresses have been extrapolated in  the global model calculation from the stresses at the integration  points. Therefore, the section stresses are not particular accurate and  generally the global equilibrium of the submodel will not be well fulfilled,  resulting in stress concentrations near the nodes which are fixed in the  submodel. Therefore, the use of section stresses is not recommended. A  better procedure is the application of nodal forces  (*CLOAD) at the intersection. These nodal forces may be  obtained by performing a preliminary submodel calculation with displacement  boundary conditions and requesting nodal force output.</LI></UL><P>For the application of a pressure on a facial surface there is one optionalparameter AMPLITUDE specifying the name of the amplitude by which the pressureis to be multiplied (cf. *AMPLITUDE). The load label forpressure is P.<P>If more than one *DSLOAD card occurs in the input deck, or a *DLOAD and atleast one *DSLOAD card, the rules explained underneath the keyword *DLOAD also apply here.<P><P><BR><P>First line:<UL><LI>*DSLOAD</LI><LI>For submodels: enter the parameter SUBMODEL (no argument) and STEP with its argument</LI></UL><P>Following line for surface loading on submodels:<UL><LI>Element number or element set label.</LI><LI>Distributed load type label.</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P>Following line for pressure application on a surface:<UL><LI>Surface name.</LI><LI>Load label (the only available right now is P for pressure)</LI><LI>Pressure.</LI></UL>Repeat this line if needed.<P><PRE>
