Calculating the normals in the nodes</A>
</H3>

<P>
The calculation of the normals (subroutine ``gen3dnor.f'') in the nodes is performed using a rather
complicated algorithm explained in Sections <A HREF="node40.html#S8">6.2.14</A> and <A HREF="node59.html#B32">6.2.33</A>. In a node
several normals can exist, think for instance of a node on the fold of a roof. Each normal
is used to perform an expansion, i.e. in a node with two normals two
expansions are performed which partially overlap (Figure
<A HREF="node40.html#shell">74</A>). Theoretically, as many expansions can be needed as there are
elements to which the node belongs to. Therefore, to store the expansions and
the normals a structure is used similar to the field kon to store the topology of
the elements.

<P>
The field kon is a one-dimensional field containing the topology of all
elements, one after the other. The entry ipkon(i) points to the location in
field kon just
before the start of the topology of element i, i.e. the first node of element i is
located at position ipkon(i)+1 in field kon, the last node at position
ipkon(i)+numnod, where numnod is the number of nodes of the element, e.g. 20
 for a 20-node element. Thus, local position m of element j corresponds to
 global node number kon(ipkon(j)+m). Now, a similar structure is used for the
 normals and nodes of the expansions since these variables are linked to a
 local position within an element rather than to a global node number. To this
 end the two-dimensional field iponor and one-dimensional fields xnor and knor
 are used. 

<P>
The entry iponor(1,ipkon(j)+m) points to the location of the normal at local
position m of element j within field xnor, i.e. the three components of the
normal are stored in xnor(iponor(1,ipkon(j)+m)+1),
xnor(iponor(1,ipkon(j)+m)+2) and xnor(iponor(1,ipkon(j)+m)+3). In the same way
the entry iponor(2,ipkon(j)+m) points to the location of the new nodes of the
expansion at local position m of element j within field knor, i.e. the three
new node numbers are stored at knor(iponor(2,ipkon(j)+m)+n), n=1,2,3. The order of
the node numbers is illustrated in Figure <A HREF="node40.html#2dexpansion">73</A>. This applies to
the expansion of two-dimensional elements. For the expansion of beam elements
xnor contains six entries: three entries for unit vector 1 and three entries
for unit vector 2 (Figure <A HREF="node59.html#c1d3">77</A>), i.e.
xnor(iponor(1,ipkon(j)+m)+1),...,xnor(iponor(1,ipkon(j)+m)+6). Since the
expansion of a beam element leads to 8 extra nodes (Figure <A HREF="node59.html#c1d">78</A>)
8 entries are provided in field knor. The field xnor is initialized with the
values from keyword card <A HREF="node295.html#normal">*NORMAL</A>. 

<P>
The procedure runs as follows: for a node i all 2D elements to which the
node belongs are determined. Then, the normals on these elements are
determined using the procedure explained in Section <A HREF="node40.html#S8">6.2.14</A> starting with the
normals predefined by a *NORMAL keyword card. Notice that extra normals are
also defined at thickness discontinuities, offset discontinuities or element
type changes (e.g. a plane stress element adjacent to a shell
element). Therefore, this step is more about how many different expansions are
needed rather than different normals:
if, for instance the thickness of a flat plate changes discontinuously, two
different expansions are needed at the discontinuity nodes although the normal
does not change. Next, all beam elements to which
node i belongs are determined and normals are determined in a similar way. For
each normal appropriate nodes are generate for the expansion (three for 2D
elements, eight for 1D elements). If overall only one normal suffices, no
knot exists and no rigid body needs to be defined, unless the rotational
degrees of freedom in the node are constrained or moments applied. If more than one normal
ensues or the rotational degrees of freedom are addressed by the user in any way, a rigid body is generated. In a rigid body definition all expansion
nodes of shells and beam participate, for plane stress, plane strain or
axisymmetric elements only the midside nodes take part.

<P>
Caution is due to the fact that the entries in the fields kon and iponor do
not correspond to the same nodes any more after leaving gen3delem.f. This is
because the original element topology of the elements is shifted in field kon
to allow the storage of the expanded topology. For instance, suppose that
element i is a S8 element. Upon entering gen3delem.f the topology of this
element is stored in entries (kon(ipkon(i)+j,j=1,8) and soon afterwards the pointers to the
expanded nodes and normals are stored in (ipkon(ipkon(i)+j,j=1,8). However,
upon leaving gen3delem.f the original topology is shifted to
(kon(ipkon(i)+20+j,j=1,8) (a S8 element is expanded into a 20-node element) and the expanded topology is stored in
(kon(ipkon(i)+j),j=1,20). Field iponor, however, is not changed.
