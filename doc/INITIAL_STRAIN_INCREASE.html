The values are added to the initial strains already present in the model. The use of this option requires the previous use of *INITIAL   CONDITIONS, TYPE=PLASTIC STRAIN or *MODEL   CHANGE, TYPE=ELEMENT, ADD or  *MODEL   CHANGE, TYPE=ELEMENT, ADD=STRAIN FREE.  <P> The resulting initial strain components are subtracted from the strain components computed from the displacement field. If thermal strains are relevant they are additionally subtracted. The resulting strain is used to compute the stress and tangent stiffness matrix using the appropriate constitutive equations.    <P> Please note that the strains have to be provided in the GLOBAL (rectangular) coordinate system, no matter whether an *ORIENTATION card or *TRANSFORM card applies to the corresponding element.  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*INITIAL STRAIN INCREASE </LI> </UL>  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Following line:  <UL> <LI>Element number. </LI> <LI>Integration point number. </LI> <LI>Value of first initial strain increase component (xx) in the GLOBAL coordinate   system x-y-z. </LI> <LI>Value of second initial strain increase component (yy) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z. </LI> <LI>Value of third initial strain increase component (zz) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z. </LI> <LI>Value of fourth initial strain increase component (xy) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z. </LI> <LI>Value of fifth initial strain increase component (xz) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z. </LI> <LI>Value of sixth initial strain increase component (yz) in the GLOBAL coordinate system x-y-z. </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed.
