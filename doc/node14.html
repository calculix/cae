Lid-driven cavity</A>
</H2>

<P>
The lid-driven cavity is a well-known benchmark problem for viscous
incompressible fluid flow [<A
 HREF="node487.html#Zienkiewicz2">92</A>]. The geometry at stake is shown in Figure
<A HREF="#lidgeo">26</A>. We are dealing with a square cavity consisting of three rigid
walls with no-slip conditions and a lid moving with a tangential unit
velocity. We are
interested in the velocity and pressure distribution for a Reynolds number of
400.

<P>
Although the problem is
essentially 2-dimensional it was modeled as a 3-dimensional problem with unit
thickness since 2-dimensional fluid capabilities are not available in
CalculiX. The mesh (2D projection) is shown in Figure <A HREF="#lidmesh">27</A>. It
consists of 8-node brick elements. There is one element layer across the
thickness. This is sufficient, since the results do not vary in thickness
direction. The input deck starts with the coordinates of the nodes and the
topology of the elements. The element type for fluid volumetric elements is the same
as for structural elements with the C replaced by F (fluid): F3D6. The faces
belonging to solid surfaces are listed next. A face is characterized by an
element number and an internal face number. Solid surfaces are surfaces at
which the fluid adheres, i.e. in the presence of viscosity the velocity vector
adjacent to a solid surface is the same as the velocity of the surface
itself. All solid surfaces must be collected into a SURFACE definition with
the name SOLIDSURFACE (no upper case required, though).

<P>
The material definition consists of the density, the heat capacity and the
dynamic viscosity. The density is set to 1. The heat capacity and the dynamic viscosity are entered underneath the <A HREF="node302.html#fluidconstants">*FLUID
  CONSTANTS</A> keyword. The heat capacity is not needed
since the calculation does not involve temperatures, so its value here is irrelevant. The
value of the dynamic viscosity was chosen such that the Reynolds number is
400. The Reynolds number is defined as velocity times length divided by the
kinematic viscosity. The velocity of the lid is 1, its length is 1 and since
the density is 1 the kinematic and dynamic viscosity coincide. Consequently,
the kinematic viscosity takes the value 1/400. The material is assigned to the
elements by means of the *SOLID SECTION card.

<P>
The unknowns of the problem are the velocity and static pressure. No thermal
boundary conditions are provided, so the temperature is irrelevant. All
initial values for the velocity and pressure are set by means of the *INITIAL
CONDITIONS,TYPE=FLUID VELOCITY and *INITIAL CONDITIONS,TYPE=PRESSURE
cards. Notice that for the velocity the initial conditions have to be
specified for each degree of freedom separately. 

<P>
The step is as usual started with the *STEP keyword. The maximum number of increments,
however, is for fluid calculations governed by the parameter INCF. For steady
state calculations the keyword *STATIC is to be used. If there are no time
increment values beneath this line the increment size is
automatically chosen such that the procedure is stable. The boundary
conditions for fluid calculations are defined on the faces and are prescribed
using the *BOUNDARYF card.  Recall that
non-homogeneous (i.e. nonzero) boundary conditions have to be defined within a
step, homogeneous ones may be defined before or within the step. Here, all
boundary conditions have been defined within the step. They include zero
velocity at the fixed walls, a velocity of 1 in the y-direction on the lid,
and zero velocity in z-direction on the side walls. The pressure has been set
to 1 on face 3 of element 1600. In CFD pressure boundary conditions can only
be set on faces for which not all velocity components are
prescribed. Consequently, in the present example, the pressure could not have
been set on faces belonging to the walls and the lid.

<P>
The step ends with a nodal print request for the velocity VF and the
static pressure PSF. The printing frequency is defined to be 5000 by means of the
FREQUENCYF parameter. This means, that results will be stored every 5000 increments.

<P>
The velocity distribution in y-direction (i.e. the direction tangential to the lid) is
shown in Figure <A HREF="#lidvelx">28</A>. The smallest value (-0.33) and its location
agree very well with the results in [<A
 HREF="node487.html#Zienkiewicz2">92</A>]. Figure <A HREF="#lidvel">29</A>
shows a vector plot of the velocity. Near the lid there is a large gradient,
in the lower left and lower right corner are dead zones. The pressure plot
(Figure <A HREF="#lidpre">30</A>) reveals a low pressure zone in the center of the major
vortex and in the left upper corner. The right upper corner is a stagnation
point for the y-component of the velocity and is characterized by a
significant pressure built-up.
