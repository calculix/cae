Optimization of a simply supported beam</A>
</H2>

<P>
In this section the optimization of a simply supported beam w.r.t. stress
and subject to a non-increasing mass constraint is treated. This example
shows how an optimization might be performed, the procedure itself is manually
and by no way optimized. For industrial applications one would typically write
generally applicable scripts taking care of the manual steps explained here.

<P>
This example uses the files opt1.inp, opt1.f, opt2.inp, opt2.f and op3.inp,
all available in the CalculiX test suite. File opt1.inp contains the geometry
and the loading of the problem at stake: the structure is a beam simply
supported at its ends (hinge on one side, rolls on the other) and a point
force in the middle. The von Mises stresses are shown in Figure <A HREF="#opt1">49</A>.

<P>

<P>
The target of the optimization if to reduce the stresses in the beam. The
highest stresses occur in the middle of the beam and at the supports
(cf. Figure <A HREF="#opt1">49</A>). Since the stresses at the supports will not decrease
due to a geometrical change of the beam (the peak stresses at the supports are
cause by the point-like nature of the support) the set of design variables
(i.e. the nodes in which the geometry of the beam is allowed to change during
the optimization) is defined as all nodes in the beam except for a set of nodes in the vicinity
of the supports. These latter nodes are shown in Figure <A HREF="#opt2">50</A>.

<P>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
In order to perform an optimization one has to determine the sensitivity of
the objective w.r.t. the design variables taking into account any constraints
for every intermediate design step (iteration) of the optimization. 

<P>
The design variables were already discussed an constitute the set of nodes in
which the design is allowed to change. In the input deck for the present
example this is taken care of by the lines:

<P>
<PRE>
*DESIGNVARIABLES,TYPE=COORDINATE
DESIGNNODES
</PRE>

<P>
``DESIGNNODES'' is a nodal set containing the design nodes as previously
discussed. For optimization problems in which the geometry of the structure is
to be optimized the type is COORDINATE. Alternatively, one could optimize the
orientation of anisotropic materials in a structure, this is covered by
TYPE=ORIENTATION. 

<P>
The objective is the function one would like to minimize. In the present
example the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function calculated from the von Mises
stress in all design nodes (cf. <A HREF="node297.html#objective">*OBJECTIVE</A> for the
definition of this function) is to be minimized. Again, the support nodes are
not taken into account because of the local stress singularity. The objective
is taken care of by the lines:

<P>
<PRE>
*OBJECTIVE
STRESS,DESIGNNODES,10.,100.
</PRE>

<P>
in the input deck. Notice that the node set used to define the
Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function does not have to coincide with the set of
design variables (second entry underneath the *OBJECTIVE card). The third and
fourth entry underneath the *OBJECTIVE card constitute parameters in the
Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function. Specifically, the fourth entry is a
reference stress value and should be of the order of magnitude of the actual
maximum stress in the model. The third parameter allows to smear the maximum
stress value in a less or more wide region of the model. 

<P>
In addition to the objective function (only one objective function is allowed)
one or more constraints can be defined. In the actual example the mass of the
beam should not increase during the optimization. This is taken care of by

<P>
<PRE>
*CONSTRAINT
MASS,Eall,LE,1.,
</PRE>

<P>
For the meaning of the entries the reader is referred to
<A HREF="node226.html#constraint">*CONTRAINT</A>. Notice that for this constraint to be active
the user should have defined a density for the material at stake. Within
CalculiX the constraint is linearized. This means that, depending on the
increment size during an optimization, the constraint will not be satisfied exacty.

<P>
In the CalculiX run the sensitivity of the objective and all
constraints w.r.t. the design variables is calculated. The sensitivity is
nothing else but the first derivative of the objective function w.r.t. the
design variables (similarly for the constraints), i.e. the sensitivity shows
how the objective function changes if the design variable is changed. For
design variables of type COORDINATE the change of the design variables
(i.e. the design nodes) is in a direction locally orthogonal to the
geometry. So in our case the sensitivity of the stress tells us how the stress
changes if the geometry is changed in direction of the local normal (similar
with the mass CONSTRAINT). If the
sensitivity is positiv the stress increases while thickening the structure and
vice versa. This sensitivity may be postprocessed by using a filter. In the
present input deck (opt1.inp) the following filter is applied:

<P>
<PRE>
*FILTER,TYPE=LINEAR,EDGE PRESERVATION=YES,DIRECTION WEIGHTING=YES
3.

</DIV>

<P>
The filter is linear with a radius of 3 (it can be visualized as a cone at each design variable
in which the sensitivity is integrated and subsequently smeared), sharp
corners should be kept (EDGE PRESERVATION=YES, cf. <A HREF="node262.html#filter">*FILTER</A>)
and surfaces with a clearly different orientation (e.g. orthogonal) are not
taken into account while filtering (or taken into account to a lesser degree,
DIRECTION WEIGHTING=YES). The filtering is applied to the objective function
and to each constraint separately. Figure <A HREF="#opt3">51</A> shows the stress
sensitivity before filtering, Figure <A HREF="#opt4">52</A> the stress sensitivity after
filtering and Figure <A HREF="#opt5">53</A> the mass sensitivity after filtering. All of
this information is obtained by requesting SEN underneath the *NODE FILE
card. Notice that the sensitivity is normalized after filtering.

</DIV>

<P>
After calculating the filtered sensitivities of the objective function and the
constraints separately they are joined by projecting the sensitivity of the active constraints
on the sensitivity of the objective function. This results in Figure
<A HREF="#opt6">54</A>.

<P>
The sensitivities calculated in this way allow us to perform an
optimization. The simplest concept is the steepest gradient algorithm. This
entails to change the geometry in the direction of the steepest gradient. In
the present calculations only one gradient is calculated (the one in the
direction of the local normal) since a geometry change parallel to the surface
of the structure generally does not change the geometry at all. So the
geometry is changed in the direction of the local normal by an amount to be
defined by the user. It is usually a percentage of the local sensitivity. This
is taken care of by the FORTRAN program opt1.f. It reads the normal
information and the sensitivities from file opt1.frd and defines a geometry
change of 10 % of the normalized sensitivity in the form of *BOUNDARY
cards. These cards are stored in file opt1.bou. 

<P>
In order to run opt1.f it has to be compiled (e.g. by gfortran -oopt1.exe
opt1.f) and subsequently executed (e.g. by ./opt1.exe). The sensitivities,
however, only take care of the change of the boundary nodes which are also
design variables. In order to maintain a good quality mesh the other boundary
nodes and the internal nodes should be appropriately moved as well. This is
taken care of by a subsequent linear elastic calculation with the
sensitivity-based surface geometry change as boundary conditions. This is
taken care of by input deck opt2.inp.

<P>
This input deck contains the original geometry of the beam. In addition, the
sensitivity-based surface geometry change stored in opt1.bou is included by
the statement:

<P>
<PRE>
*INCLUDE,INPUT=opt1.bou
</PRE>

<P>
Furthermore, preservation of sharp edges and corners in the original structure
is taken care of by linear equations stored in file opt1.equ. They were
generated by CalculiX during the opt1.inp run. They are included by the statement:

<P>
<PRE>
*INCLUDE,INPUT=opt1.equ
</PRE>

<P>
The resulting deformed mesh is shown in Figure <A HREF="#opt7">55</A> (a refinement of the
procedure could involve to use high E-moduli in opt2.inp at the free surface and decrease
their value as a function of the distance from the free surface; this guarantees
good quality elements at the free surface). The beam was
thickened in the middle, where the von Mises stresses were highest. This
should lead to a decrease of the highest stress value. In order to check this
a new sensitivity calculation was done on the deformed structure. To this end
the coordinates and the displacements are read from opt2.frd by the FORTRAN
program opt2.f (to be compiled and executed in a similar way as opt1.f), and
the sum is stored in file opt3.inc. This file is included in input deck
opt3.inp, which is a copy of opt1.inp with the coordinates replaced by the
ones in opt3.inc. The resulting von Mises stresses are shown in Figure
<A HREF="#opt8">56</A>. The von Mises stress in the middle of the lower surface of the
beam has indeed decreased from 114 to about 80 (MPa if the selected units were
mm, N, s and K). Further improvements can be obtained by running several iterations.
