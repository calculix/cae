*SUBMODEL
</H2>

<P>
Keyword type: model definition

<P>
This keyword is used to define submodel boundaries. A submodel is a part of a
bigger model for which an analysis has already been performed. A submodel is
used if the user would like to analyze some part in more detail by using a
more dense mesh or a more complicated material model, just to name a few
reasons. At those locations where the submodel has been cut from the global
model, the boundary conditions are derived from the global model
results. These are the boundaries defined by the *SUBMODEL card. In addition,
in a purely mechanical calculation it allows to map the temperatures to all
nodes in the submodel (not just the boundary nodes).

<P>
There are four kinds of boundary conditions one may apply: the user may map the
displacements from the global model (or temperatures in a purely thermal
or a thermo-mechanical calculation ) to the boundaries of the submodel, the stresses
to the boundaries of the submodel, the forces
to the boundaries of the submodel or
the user may select to map the temperatures in a purely mechanical calculation
to all nodes belonging to the submodel. Mapping the stresses or forces may require
fixing a couple of additional nodes to prevent rigid body modes.

<P>
In order to perform the mapping (which is basically an interpolation) the
global model is remeshed with tetrahedra. The resulting mesh is stored in file
TetMasterSubmodel.frd and can be viewed with CalculiX GraphiX.

<P>
There are three parameters of which two are required. The parameters TYPE and
INPUT are required. TYPE can take the value SURFACE or NODE, depending on
whether the user wants to define stress boundary conditions or displacement/temperature/force
boundary conditions, respectively. The parameter INPUT specifies the file, in
which the results of the global model are stored. This must be a .frd file.

<P>
A submodel of the SURFACE type is defined by element face surfaces. These must
be defined using the *SURFACE,TYPE=ELEMENT card. Submodels of the NODE type
are defined by sets of nodes. It is not allowed to define a local coordinate
system (with a <A HREF="node367.html#transform">*TRANSFORM</A> card) in these nodes. Several submodel cards may be used in one and
the same input deck, and they can be of different types. The global result
file, however, must be the same for all *SUBMODEL cards. Furthermore, a node
(for the NODE type submodel) or an element face (for the SURFACE type
submodel) may only belong to at most one *SUBMODEL.

<P>
The optional parameter GLOBAL ELSET defines an elset in the global model which
will be used for the interpolation of the displacements or stresses onto the
submodel boundary defined underneath the *SUBMODEL card. For the creation of
this element set the parameter GENERATE is not allowed
(cf. <A HREF="node296.html#elset">*ELSET</A>). Although this element set contains element
numbers belonging to the global model, it must be defined in the submodel
input deck using the *ELSET card. For instance, suppose the global model
contains elements from 1 to 1000 and that the submodel contains only 10
elements numbered from 1 to 10. Both models have no elements in
common, however, they may have element numbers in common (as is the case in
this example). Suppose that the global elements to be used for the interpolation of
the boundary conditions onto the submodel have the numbers 600 up to 604. Then the following
card defines the global elset

<P>
<PRE>
*ELSET,ELSET=GLOBALSET1
600,601,602,603,604
</PRE>

<P>
and has to be included in the submodel input deck, although in this deck only
elements 1 to 10 are defined by a <A HREF="node292.html#element">*ELEMENT</A> card, i.e. in
the submodel input deck element numbers are referenced which are not at all
defined within the deck. This is fine for submodel decks only.

<P>
If no GLOBAL ELSET parameter is used the
default GLOBAL ELSET is the
complete global model. Global elsets of different *SUBMODEL cards may have
elements in common.

<P>
Notice that the *SUBMODEL card only states that the model at stake is a
submodel and that it defines part of the boundary to be of the nodal or of
the surface type. Whether actually displacements or stresses will be applied
by interpolation from the global model depends on whether a
<A HREF="node248.html#boundary">*BOUNDARY</A>, <A HREF="node287.html#dsload">*DSLOAD</A>,
<A HREF="node262.html#cload">*CLOAD</A>  or <A HREF="node364.html#temperature">*TEMPERATURE</A>, 
card is used, respectively, each of them accompanied by the parameter SUBMODEL.

<P>
Mapping displacements or temperatures to the boundary of a submodel is usually
very accurate. For stresses, the results may be unsatisfactory, since the
stress values stored in the global model (and which are the basis for the
interpolation) are extrapolations of integration
point values. This frequently leads to a situation in which equilibrium for
the submodel is not satisfied. To circumvent this, the user may perform a
submodel analysis with displacement boundary conditions, store the forces at
the boundaries in the frd-file and use this file as global model for a
subsequent submodel analysis with force boundary conditions. In this way a
correct force-driven analysis can be performed, for instance for crack
propagation analyses in the submodel (displacement-driven analyses prevent the
crack from growing).

states that the present model is a submodel. The nodes with number 1, 8 and
the nodes in the node set &ldquo;part&rdquo; belong to a Dirichlet part of the boundary, i.e. a part on which the
displacements are obtained from the global model. The results of the global
model are stored in file global.frd. Whether they are really
used, depends on whether a *BOUNDARY,SUBMODEL card is defined for these nodes.
