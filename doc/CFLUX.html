Optional parameters are OP, AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, USER and ADD. OP can take the value NEW or MOD. OP=MOD is default and implies that the concentrated fluxes applied to different nodes in previous steps are kept. Specifying a flux in a node for which a flux was defined in a previous step replaces this  value. A flux specified in a node for which a flux was already defined within the same step is added to this value. OP=NEW implies that all concentrated fluxes applied in previous steps are removed. If multiple *CFLUX cards are present in a step this parameter takes effect for the first *CFLUX card only.   <P> The AMPLITUDE parameter allows for the specification of an amplitude by which the flux values are scaled (mainly used for nonlinear static and dynamic calculations). Thus, in that case the values entered on the *CFLUX card are interpreted as reference values to be multiplied with the (time dependent) amplitude value to obtain the actual value. At the end of the step the reference value is replaced by the actual value at that time. In subsequent steps this value is kept constant unless it is explicitly redefined or the amplitude is defined using TIME=TOTAL TIME in which case the amplitude keeps its validity.   <P> The TIME DELAY parameter modifies the AMPLITUDE parameter. As such, TIME DELAY must be preceded by an AMPLITUDE name. TIME DELAY is a time shift by which the AMPLITUDE definition it refers to is moved in positive time direction. For instance, a TIME DELAY of 10 means that for time t the amplitude is taken which applies to time t-10. The TIME DELAY parameter must only appear once on one and the same keyword card.  <P> If the USER parameter is selected the concentrated flux values are determined by calling the user subroutine cflux.f, which must be provided by the user. This applies to all nodes listed beneath the *CFLUX keyword. Any flux values specified following the temperature degree of freedom are not taken into account. If the USER parameter is selected, the AMPLITUDE parameter has no effect and should not be used.   <P> Finally, the ADD parameter allows the user to specify that the flux should be added to previously defined fluxes in the same node, irrespective whether these fluxes were defined in the present step or in a previous step.  <P> The use of the *CFLUX card makes sense for heat transfer calculations or coupled thermo-mechanical calculations only. Heat fluxes are applied to degree of freedom 11.  <P> If more than one *CFLUX card occurs within the input deck the following rules apply:  <P> If a *CFLUX card is applied to the same node AND in the same direction as in a previous application, then  <UL> <LI>if the previous application was in the same step the *CFLUX value is   added, else it is replaced </LI> <LI>the new amplitude (including none) overwrites the previous amplitude </LI> </UL>  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*CFLUX </LI> <LI>Enter any needed parameters and their value. </LI> </UL>  <P> Following line:  <UL> <LI>Node number or node set label. </LI> <LI>Degree of freedom (11). </LI> <LI>Magnitude of the flux </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed.  <P> <PRE>
