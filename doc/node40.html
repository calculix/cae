Eight-node shell element (S8 and S8R)
</H3>

<P>
This element is a general purpose 4-sided shell element. The node
numbering and the direction of the normal to the surface is shown in
Figure <A HREF="#c2d8">72</A>.

<P>
In CalculiX, quadratic shell elements are automatically expanded into 20-node
brick elements. The way this is done is illustrated in Figure
<A HREF="#2dexpansion">73</A>. For each shell node three new nodes are generated
according to the scheme on the right of Figure <A HREF="#2dexpansion">73</A>. With
these nodes a new 20-node brick element is generated: for a S8 element
a C3D20 element, for a S8R element a C3D20R element.

<P>
Since a shell element can be curved, the normal to the shell surface
is defined in each node separately. For this purpose the
<A HREF="node295.html#normal">*NORMAL</A> keyword card can be used. If no normal is
defined by the user, it will be calculated automatically by CalculiX
based on the local geometry. 

<P>
If a node belongs to more than one shell element, all, some or none of
the normals on these elements in the node at stake might have been defined by the user (by
means of *NORMAL). The
failing normals are determined based on the local geometry (notice, however,
that for significantly distorted elements it may not be possible to determine
the normal; this particularly applies to elements in which the middle nodes
are way off the middle position). The number
of normals is subsequently reduced using the following procedure. First, the
element with the lowest element number with an explicitly defined
normal in
this set, if any, is taken and used as reference. Its normal is defined as
reference normal and the element is stored in a new subset. All other
elements of the same type in the set
for which the normal has an angle smaller than <IMG
 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img252.png"
 ALT="$ 0.5^\circ$"> with the
reference normal and
which have the same local thickness and offset are also included in this
subset. The elements in the subset are considered to have the same
normal, which is defined as the normed mean of all normals
in the subset. This procedure is repeated for the elements in the set
minus the subset until no elements are left
with an explicitly defined normal. Now, the element with the lowest
element number of all elements left in the set is used as
reference. Its normal is defined as
reference normal and the element is stored in a new subset. All other
elements left in the set
for which the normal has an angle smaller than <IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img253.png"
 ALT="$ 20^\circ$"> with the
reference normal and
which have the same local thickness and offset are also included in this
subset. The normed mean of all normals
in the subset is assigned as new normal to all elements in the subset. This procedure is repeated for the elements left until
a normal has been defined in each element.

<P>
This procedure leads to one or more normals in one and
the same node. If only one normal is defined, this node is expanded
once into a set of three new nodes and the resulting three-dimensional
expansion is continuous in the node. If more than one normal is
defined, the node is expanded as many times as there are normals in
the node. To assure that the resulting 3D elements are connected,
the newly generated nodes are considered as a knot. A knot is a rigid body
which is allowed to expand uniformly. This implies that a knot is
characterized by seven degrees of freedom: three translations, three rotations
and a uniform expansion. Graphically, the shell elements partially
overlap (Figure <A HREF="#shell">74</A>).

<P>
Consequently, a node leads to a knot if 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the direction of the local normals in the elements participating
in the node differ beyond a given amount. Notice that this also applies to
neighboring elements having the inverse normal. Care should be taken
that the elements in plates and similar structures are oriented in a
consistent way to avoid the generation of knots and the induced
nonlinearity. 
</LI>
<LI>several types of elements participate (e.g. shells and beams).
</LI>
<LI>the thickness is not the same in all participating elements.
</LI>
<LI>the offset is not the same in all participating elements.
</LI>
<LI>a rotation or a moment is applied in the node (only for dynamic
calculations)
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In CalculiX versions prior to and including version 2.7 a knot was also
introduced as soon as the user applied a rotation or a moment to a
node. Right now, this is still the case for dynamic calculations (cf. listing
above). However, in static calculations, starting with version 2.8 this type of loading is handled by using mean
rotation MPC's (cf. Section <A HREF="node367.html#meanrotationmpc">8.7.1</A>). The mean rotation MPC's
are generated automatically, so the user does not have to take care of
that. It generally leads to slightly better results then by use of
knots. However, the use of mean rotation MPC's prohibits the application of
drilling moments, i.e. moments about an axis perpendicular to a shell
surface. Similarly, no drilling rotation should be prescribed, unless all
rotational degrees of freedom are set to zero in the node. If the shell
surface is not aligned along the global coordinate directions, prescribing a
moment or rotation aboun an axis perpendicular to the drilling direction may
require the definition of a local coordinate system. Also note that the
rotation in a mean rotation MPC should not exceed 90 degrees. Starting with
version 2.15 any nonzero drilling moment or rotation is automatically removed
and a warning is issued. In earlier versions, a drilling moment or rotation
led to an error, forcing the program to abort.

<P>
Beam and shell elements are always connected in a
stiff way if they share common nodes. This, however, does not apply to
plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements. Although any
mixture of 1D and 2D elements generates a knot, the knot is modeled
as a hinge for any plane stress, plane strain or axisymmetric elements
involved in the knot. This is necessary to account for the special
nature of these elements (the displacement normal to the symmetry
plane and normal to the radial planes is zero for plane elements and
axisymmetric elements, respectively).

<P>
The translational node of the knot (cfr REF NODE in the
<A HREF="node307.html#rigidbody">*RIGID BODY</A> keyword card) is the knot generating
node, the rotational node is extra generated.

<P>
The thickness of the shell element can be defined on the
<A HREF="node311.html#shellsection">*SHELL SECTION</A> keyword card. It applies to the
complete element. Alternatively, a nodal thickness in each node
separately can be defined using <A HREF="node290.html#nodalthickness">*NODAL
THICKNESS</A>. In that way, a shell with variable thickness
can be modeled. Thicknesses defined by a *NODAL THICKNESS card take
precedence over thicknesses defined by a *SHELL SECTION card. The
thickness always applies in normal direction. The <A HREF="node311.html#shellsection">*SHELL
SECTION</A> card is also used to assign a material to the
shell elements and is therefore indispensable.

<P>
The offset of a shell element can be set on the <A HREF="node311.html#shellsection">*SHELL
SECTION</A> card. Default is zero. The unit of the offset
is the local shell thickness. An offset of 0.5 means that the user-defined
shell reference surface is in reality the top surface of the expanded
element. The offset can take any real value. Consequently, it can be used to
define composite materials. Defining three different shell elements using
exactly the same nodes but with offsets -1, 0 and 1 (assuming the thickness is
the same) leads to a three-layer composite.

<P>
However, due to the introduction of a knot in every node of such a composite,
the deformation is usually too stiff. Therefore, a different method has been
coded to treat composites. Right now, it can only be used for 8-node shells
with reduced integration (S8R) and 6-node shell elements (S6). Instead of defining as many shells as there
are layers the user only defines one shell element, and uses the option COMPOSITE on
the <A HREF="node311.html#shellsection">*SHELL SECTION</A> card. Underneath the latter card
the user can define as many layers as needed. Internally, the shell element is
expanded into only one 3-D brick element but the number of integration points
across the thickness amounts to twice the number of layers. During the
calculation the integration points are assigned the material properties
appropriate for the layer they belong to. In the .dat file the user will find
the displacements of the global 3-D element and the stresses in all
integration points (provided the user has requested the corresponding output
using the <A HREF="node294.html#nodeprint">*NODE PRINT</A> and <A HREF="node256.html#elprint">*EL PRINT</A>
card). In the .frd file, however, each layer is expanded independently and the
displacements and stresses are interpolated/extrapolated accordingly (no
matter whether the parameter OUTPUT=3D was used). The
restrictions on this kind of composite element are right now:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>can only be used for S8R and S6 elements
</LI>
<LI>reaction forces (RF) cannot be requested in the .frd file.
</LI>
<LI>the use of *NODAL THICKNESS is not allowed
</LI>
<LI>the error estimators cannot be used.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In composite materials it is frequently important to be able to define a local
element coordinate system. Indeed, composites usually consist of layers of
anisotropic materials (e.g. fiber reinforced) exhibiting a different
orientation in each layer. To this end the <A HREF="node298.html#orientation">*ORIENTATION</A>
card can be used. 

<P>
First of all, it is of uttermost importance to realize that a shell element
ALWAYS induces the creation of a local element coordinate system, no matter
whether an orientation card was defined or not. If no orientation applies to a
specific layer of a specific shell element then a local shell coordinate system is
generated consisting of:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>a local x'-axis defined by the projection of the global x-axis on the
  shell (actually at the location of the shell which corresponds to local
  coordinates <IMG
 WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img255.png"
 ALT="$ \xi=0$">, <IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img256.png"
 ALT="$ \eta=0$">), or, if the angle between the global x-axis
  and the normal to the shell is smaller than <!-- MATH
 $0.1^{\circ}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img257.png"
 ALT="$ 0.1^{\circ}$">, by the projection
  of the global z-axis on the shell.
</LI>
<LI>a local y'-axis such that <!-- MATH
 $y' = z' \times x'$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="84" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img258.png"
 ALT="$ y' = z' \times x'$">.
</LI>
<LI>a local z'-axis coinciding with the normal on the shell (defined such
  that the nodes are defined clockwise in the element topology when looking in
  the direction of the normal).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Notice that this also applies in shell which are not defined as composites
(can be considered as one-layer composites). 

<P>
If an orientation is applied to a specific layer of a specific shell element
then a local shell coordinate system is generated consisting of:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>a local x'-axis defined by the projection of the local x-axis defined by
  the orientation on the
  shell (actually at the location of the shell which corresponds to local
  coordinates <IMG

 SRC="img255.png"
 ALT="$ \xi=0$">, <IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img256.png"
 ALT="$ \eta=0$">), or, if the angle between the local x-axis
  defined by the orientation
  and the normal to the shell is smaller than <!-- MATH

<IMG

 SRC="img257.png"
 ALT="$ 0.1^{\circ}$">, by the projection

</LI>

</LI>
<LI>a local z'-axis coinciding with the normal on the shell (defined such
  that the nodes are defined clockwise in the element topology when looking in
  the direction of the normal).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The treatment of the boundary conditions for shell elements is
straightforward. The user can independently fix any translational
degree of freedom (DOF 1 through 3) or any rotational DOF (DOF 4
through 6). Here, DOF 4 is the rotation about the global or local x-axis, DOF 5
about the global or local y-axis and DOF 6 about the global or local
z-axis. Local axes apply if the transformation
(<A HREF="node328.html#transform">*TRANSFORM</A>) has been defined, else the global system
applies. A hinge is defined by fixing the
translational degrees of freedom only. Recall that it is not allowed to
constrain a rotation about the drilling axis on a shell, unless the rotations
about all axes in the node are set to zero.

<P>
For an
internal hinge between 1D or 2D elements the nodes must be doubled
and connected with MPC's. The connection between 3D elements and all
other elements (1D or 2D) is always hinged.

<P>
Point forces defined in a shell node are not modified if a knot
is generated (the reference node of the rigid body is the shell node). If no knot is
generated, the point load is divided among the expanded nodes
according to a 1/2-1/2 ratio for a shell mid-node and a 1/6-2/3-1/6
ratio for a shell end-node. Concentrated bending moments or torques are
defined as point loads (<A HREF="node223.html#cload">*CLOAD</A>) acting on degree four
to six in the node. Their use generates a knot in the node.

<P>
Distributed loading can be defined by the label P in the
<A HREF="node247.html#dload">*DLOAD</A> card. A positive value corresponds to a
pressure load in normal direction. 

<P>
In addition to a temperature for the reference surface of the shell, a
temperature gradient in normal direction can be specified on the
<A HREF="node325.html#temperature">*TEMPERATURE</A> card. Default is zero.

<P>
Concerning the output, nodal quantities requested by the keyword
<A HREF="node294.html#nodeprint">*NODE PRINT</A> are stored in the shell nodes. They are obtained by averaging the nodal values of the
expanded element. For instance, the value in local shell node 1 are obtained
by averaging the nodal value of expanded nodes 1 and 5. Similar relationships
apply to the other nodes, in 6-node shells:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>shell node 1 = average of expanded nodes 1 and 4
</LI>
<LI>shell node 2 = average of expanded nodes 2 and 5
</LI>
<LI>shell node 3 = average of expanded nodes 3 and 6
</LI>
<LI>shell node 4 = average of expanded nodes 7 and 10
</LI>
<LI>shell node 5 = average of expanded nodes 8 and 11
</LI>
<LI>shell node 6 = average of expanded nodes 9 and 12
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In 8-node shells:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>shell node 1 = average of expanded nodes 1 and 5
</LI>
<LI>shell node 2 = average of expanded nodes 2 and 6
</LI>
<LI>shell node 3 = average of expanded nodes 3 and 7
</LI>
<LI>shell node 4 = average of expanded nodes 4 and 8
</LI>
<LI>shell node 5 = average of expanded nodes 9 and 13
</LI>
<LI>shell node 6 = average of expanded nodes 10 and 14
</LI>
<LI>shell node 7 = average of expanded nodes 11 and 15
</LI>
<LI>shell node 8 = average of expanded nodes 12 and 16
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Element quantities, requested by <A HREF="node256.html#elprint">*EL PRINT</A> are stored in
the integration points of the expanded elements.

<P>
Default storage for quantities requested by the <A HREF="node292.html#nodefile">*NODE FILE</A>
and <A HREF="node255.html#elfile">*EL FILE</A> is in the expanded nodes. This has the
advantage that the true three-dimensional results can be viewed in the
expanded structure, however, the nodal numbering is different from the shell
nodes. By selecting OUTPUT=2D the results are stored in the original shell nodes. The same averaging
procedure applies as for the *NODE PRINT command. 

<P>
In thin structures two words of caution are due: the first is  with respect to
reduced integration. If the aspect ratio of the beams is very large (slender
beams, aspect ratio of 40 or more) reduced integration will give you far better results than full
integration. However, due to the small thickness hourglassing can
readily occur, especially if point loads are applied. This results in
displacements which are widely wrong, however, the stresses and section forces
are
correct. Usually also the mean displacements across the section are fine. If
not,
full integration combined with smaller elements might be necessary.
 Secondly, thin structures can easily
exhibit large strains and/or rotations. Therefore, most calculations require
the use of the NLGEOM parameter on the <A HREF="node318.html#step">*STEP</A> card.
