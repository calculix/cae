This includes static temperature, velocity and static pressure.  <P> The following degrees of freedom are being used:  <P>  <UL> <LI>1: velocity in the local x-direction </LI> <LI>2: velocity in the local y-direction </LI> <LI>3: velocity in the local z-direction </LI> <LI>8: static pressure </LI> <LI>11: static temperature </LI> </UL>  <P> If no *TRANSFORM card applied to the node at stake, the local directions coincide with the global ones.  <P> Optional parameters are AMPLITUDE, TIME DELAY, and USER. Their meaning is the same as for the *BOUNDARY card.  <P> The main differences with the *BOUNDARY card are:  <P>  <UL> <LI>the *BOUNDARYF card can only be used within a step </LI> <LI>for fluids the boundary conditions are applied to element faces and not to nodes. The face labels are exactly the same as for the *SURFACE card. </LI> </UL>  <P> In order to apply a fluid boundary condition to a surface the element set label underneath may be replaced by a surface name. In that case the face type label takes the value &ldquo;S&rdquo; without any number following.  <P> Thus, the cards run like:  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*BOUNDARYF </LI> <LI>Enter any needed parameters and their value. </LI> </UL>  <P> Following line:  <UL> <LI>Element number or element set label </LI> <LI>Local face label of the element </LI> <LI>First degree of freedom constrained </LI> <LI>Last degree of freedom constrained. This field may be left blank if only one degree of freedom is constrained. </LI> <LI>Actual magnitude of the prescribed displacement (default is zero) </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed. For the local face numbering the reader is referred to the *DLOAD card.  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*BOUNDARYF
22,S3,2,2,.1
</PRE>  <P> assigns to degree of freedom two of local face 3 of element 22 the value 0.1. If no transformation applies this degree of freedom corresponds to the velocity in global y-direction.  <P>  </body></html>
