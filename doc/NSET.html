The parameter NSET containing the name of the set is required (maximum 80 characters), whereas the parameter GENERATE (without value) is optional. If present, nodal ranges can be expressed by their initial value, their final value, and an increment. If a set with the same name already exists, it is reopened and complemented. The name of a set is case insensitive. Internally, it is modified into upper case and a 'N' is appended to denote it as node set. Nodes are internally stored in the order they are entered, no sorting is performed.  <P> The following names are reserved (i.e. cannot be used by the user for other purposes than those for which they are reserved):  <UL> <LI>RAY: node set needed by MAXU (cf. *NODE FILE). </LI> <LI>STRESSDOMAIN: node set needed by MAXS (cf. *EL FILE). </LI> <LI>STRAINDOMAIN: node set needed by MAXE (cf. *EL FILE). </LI> <LI>SOLIDSURFACE: node set needed for turbulent CFD-CBS calculations. </LI> <LI>FREESTREAMSURFACE: node set needed for turbulent CFD-CBS calculation. </LI> </UL>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*NSET </LI> <LI>Enter any needed parameters and their values. </LI> </UL>  <P> Following line if the GENERATE parameter is omitted:  <UL> <LI>List of nodes and/or sets of nodes previously defined to be assigned to this node set (maximum 16 entries per line). </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed.  <P> Following line if the GENERATE parameter is included:  <UL> <LI>First node in set. </LI> <LI>Last node in set. </LI> <LI>Increment in nodal numbers between nodes in the set. Default is 1. </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if needed.  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*NSET,NSET=N1
1,8,831,208
*NSET,NSET=N2
100,N1
</PRE>  <P> assigns the nodes with number 1, 8, 831 and 208 to (node) set N1 and the nodes with numbers 1, 8, 831, 208 (= set N1) and 100 to set N2.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: segmentm, shell2.  <P>  </body></html>
