Contact
</H3>

<P>
In the presence of contact the convergence conditions in the previous section
are slightly modified. Let us first repeat the general convergence check
strategy (coded in checkconvergence.c):

<P>

<UL>
<LI>If, at the end of an iteration, convergence is detected then:

<UL>
<LI>a new increment is started (unless the step is finished)
</LI>
<LI>it is checked whether the size of this increment has to be decreased
  w.r.t. the present increment size
  (slow convergence) or can be increased (fast convergence)
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>else (no convergence detected)

<UL>
<LI>it is checked whether the number of allowable iterations has been
  reached, if so the program stops
</LI>
<LI>it is checked whether divergence occurred in the following order:

<UL>
<LI>due to non-convergence in a material user subroutine
</LI>
<LI>the force residual is larger than in the previous iteration AND larger
  than in the iteration before the previous iteration (only done after <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1571.png"
 ALT="$ I_0$"></B></SPAN>
  iterations). Let us call this check the major divergence check.
</LI>
<LI>due to the violation of a user-defined limit
  (e.g. temperature change limit, viscous strain limit)
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>if divergence is detected then

<UL>
<LI>if the increment size is fixed by the user
  the program stops
</LI>
<LI>else a new increment is started with a smaller size
  (unless the size is smaller than a user-defined quantity, in which case the
  program stops)
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>if no divergence is detected then a check is performed for too slow
  convergence. If this is the case then

<UL>
<LI>if the increment size is fixed by the user
  the program stops
</LI>
<LI>else a new increment is started with a smaller size
  (unless the size is smaller than a user-defined quantity, in which case the
  program stops)
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>if no divergence is detected and the convergence is not too slow the
  next iteration is started.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In the case penalty contact was defined an additional parameter iflagact is
defined expressing whether the number of contact elements changed
significantly between the present and the previous iteration. In the latter
case iflagact=1, else it takes the value zero (default). Whether a change is
significantly or not is governed by the value of the parameter delcon, which
the user can define underneath a *CONTROLS,PARAMETERS=CONTACT card (default is
0.001, i.e. 0.1 %).

<P>
Now, in the case of node-to-face penalty contact the standard convergence check algorithm is
modified as follows:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>If iflagact=1 at the end of the present iteration the counter for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1571.png"
 ALT="$ I_0$"></B></SPAN>
  and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1572.png"
 ALT="$ I_R$"></B></SPAN> is reset to zero and the value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1568.png"
 ALT="$ I_C$"></B></SPAN> is incremented by 1. 
</LI>
<LI>Mechanical convergence requires iflagact to be zero.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In the case of face-to-face penalty contact the criteria are modified as
follows:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Mechanical convergence requires iflagact to be zero.
</LI>
<LI>If convergence occurred the check whether the next increment must be
  decreased is not done
</LI>
<LI>If no convergence occurred then

<UL>
<LI>the check whether the number of allowable iterations has been reached is
  not done
</LI>
<LI>the major divergence check (see above) is only done if one of the
  following conditions is satisfied:

<UL>
<LI>the present force residual exceeds 1.e9
</LI>
<LI>iflagact is zero (no significant change in contact elements). If, in
  this case, the major divergence check points to divergence and the solution
  condition <!-- MATH
 ${c}^{\alpha}_{i,max} \le c_2 {\Delta u}^{\alpha}_{i,max}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG
 WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1546.png"
 ALT="$ {c}^{\alpha}_{i,max} \le c_2 {\Delta u}^{\alpha}_{i,max}$"></B></SPAN> is
  satisfied the aleatoric flag is set to 1. Physically, this means that the
  force residuals are increasing although the displacement solution does not
  change much, i.e. a local minimum has been reached. In order to leave this
  minimum a percentage of the contacts (default: 10 %; can be changed
  with the *CONTROLS,PARAMETERS=CONTACT card) is removed in an aleatoric way
  in order to stir the complete structure.
</LI>
<LI>the number of contact elements is oscillating since the last two
  iterations (e.g. the number of contact elements increased in the present
  iteration but decreased in the previous one or vice versa) and there is no
  significant change in the sum of the residual force in the present and
  previous iteration (compared to the sum of the residual force in the
  previous iteration and the one before the previous iteration). Physically
  this means that solution is alternating between two states.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>if divergence is detected not only the time increment is decreased, also
  the spring stiffness in case of linear pressure-overclosure and the stick
  slope are reduced by a factor of 100 (this number can be changed with the *CONTROLS,PARAMETERS=CONTACT card). This factor (variable &ldquo;kscale&rdquo; in the
  code) is reset to one at the
  next convergence detection in which case the iteration is continued until
  renewed successful convergence for kscale=1.
</LI>
<LI>the too slow convergence check is replaced by a check whether the number
  of iterations has reached the value of 60 (this number can be changed with the *CONTROLS,PARAMETERS=CONTACT card). In that case the spring stiffness in case of linear pressure-overclosure and the stick
  slope are reduced by a factor of 100 (this number can be changed with the *CONTROLS,PARAMETERS=CONTACT card). This factor (variable &ldquo;kscale&rdquo; in the
  code) is reset to one at the
  next convergence detection in which case the iteration is continued until
  renewed successful convergence for kscale=1). The time increment is NOT
  decreased, unless this is already the second cutback or higher.
