Nonlinear calculations</A>
</H3>

<P>
For nonlinear calculations the solution is found by iteration. Because a step
is possibly too large to obtain convergence, the option exists to subdivide
the step into a finite number of increments. The size of the initial increment
in a step is defined by the user (line beneath <A HREF="node316.html#static">*STATIC</A>,
<A HREF="node249.html#dynamic">*DYNAMIC</A>, <A HREF="node335.html#visco">*VISCO</A>, <A HREF="node272.html#heattransfer">*HEAT
  TRANSFER</A> or <A HREF="node233.html#coupledtemperaturedisplacement">*COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENTS</A>) and also the number of increments can be
controlled by the user (parameter DIRECT). However, in most cases it is
advisable to let the program determine the size of the increments, based on
the convergence rate of the previous increments. The solution in each
increment is obtained by iteration until the residual forces are small enough.

<P>
Therefore, the structure of nonlingeo corresponds to the flow diagram in
Figure <A HREF="#organi1">172</A>. It lists all subroutines, each line is a subroutine. On
the upper right ``preliminary'' is an abbreviation for five subroutines which
recur often. If a subroutine or a group of subroutines is enclose by square
brackets, it means that it is only run under certain conditions. In detail,
the structure of nonlingeo looks like:
