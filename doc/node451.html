The variables and the equations</A>
</H3>

<P>
In Sections <A HREF="node176.html#aeronetworks">6.9.16</A> and <A HREF="node177.html#hydronetworks">6.9.17</A> the governing equations
for aerodynamic and hydraulic networks were derived. It was shown that the
basic variables for aerodynamic networks are the total temperature, the total
pressure and the mass flow. In addition, one geometric parameter may be
defined per element as additional unknown. This option has to be coded in the
program in order to be active. Right now, this option only exists for the gate
valve. All other variables can be calculated based on
these three quantities. This is actually not a unique choice but seems to be
best suited for our purposes. For hydraulic networks these reduce to the
pressure, temperature and mass flow. This is completely different from the
structural unknowns, which are taken to be the temperature and the
displacements. Therefore, the degrees of freedom 0 to 3 which are used for
structural calculations are redefined for networks according to Table&nbsp;(<A HREF="#t8">21</A>)

A distinction is being made between corner nodes and midside nodes of fluid
elements. Remember that network elements consist of two corner nodes and one middle
node (Section <A HREF="node63.html#tnfe">6.2.37</A>). The mass flow is not necessarily uniquely
determined at the corner nodes, since more than two branches can come
together. Therefore, it is logical to define the mass flow as unknown in the
middle of a network element. The same applies to the geometric parameter, if
applicable.  Similarly, the total temperature or total pressure
may not be known within the element, since the exact location of
discontinuities (such as enlargements or orifices) is not necessarily
known. Consequently, it is advantageous to define the total temperature and
total pressure as unknowns in the corner nodes. The static temperature is not a
basic variable. Once the total temperature, mass flow and total pressure are
known, the static temperature can be calculated. It is a derived quantity.

<P>
Similar to field nactdof for structural applications a field nactdog is
introduced for network applications. It can be viewed as a matrix with 4 rows
and as many columns as there are nodes in the model (including structural
nodes; this is done to avoid additional pointing work between the local gas
node number and the global node number). It indicates whether a specific
degree of freedom in a gas node is active: if the entry is nonzero (actually
positive; contrary to nactdof nactdof does not take negative values) it is
active, else it is inactive (which means that the value is known or not
applicable because the node is a structural node). The degrees of freedom
correspond to the first three rows of Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#t8">21</A> and are repeated in
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#t9">22</A> for clarity. Here too, only the first three rows are
relevant.

Consequently, if nactdog(2,328) is nonzero, it means that the total pressure
in node 328 is an unknown in the system. Actually, the nonzero value
represents the number of the degree of freedom attached to the total pressure
in node 328. The number of the degree of freedom corresponds with the column
number in the resulting set of equations. 
What nactdog is for the degrees of freedom is nacteq for the equations. It is
a field of the same size of nactdog but now a nonzero entry indicates that a
specific conservation equation applies to the node, cf. Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#t10">23</A>.

If nacteq(1,8002) is nonzero, it means that the conservation of mass equation
has to be formulated for node 8002. The nonzero value is actually the row
number of this equation in the set of equations. If the value is zero, the
equation does not apply, e.g. because the mass flow in all adjacent elements
is known. The last row in field nacteq (at least for corner nodes) is used to
account for isothermal conditions. These only apply to gas pipes of type GAS
PIPE ISOTHERMAL and exit restrictors preceded by an isothermal gas pipe
element. An isothermal element introduces an extra equation specifying that the
static temperature in the two corner nodes of the pipe is equal. This can be
transformed into a nonlinear equation in which the total temperature in one
node (the dependent node) is written as a function of the total temperature in
the other node and the other variables (total pressure in the nodes, mass
flow). To account for this extra equation, the conservation of energy is not
expressed for the dependent node (indeed, one can argue that, in order for the
static temperatures to be equal an unknown amount of heat has to be introduced
in the dependent node. So if nacteq(3,8002)=<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img649.png"
 ALT="$ n$"></B></SPAN> is nonzero it means that node 8002
is the dependent node in an isothermal relation linking the static nodal
temperature to the one of node <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B><IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img649.png"
 ALT="$ n$"></B></SPAN>.

<P>
Field ineighe(i),i=1,...,ntg is used to determine the static temperature in an
end node. If it is zero, node i is a mid-node. If it is equal to -1, the node
is a chamber, for which the static temperature equals the total
temperature. If it is positive, its value is the element number of a gas pipe
element or restrictor element, but not equal to a restrictor wall orifice, for
which the static temperature is different from the total temperature. The mass
flow of the referred element is used to calculate the static temperature from
the total temperature.
