If the parameter TIME=TOTAL TIME is used the reference time is the total time since the start of the calculation, else it is the local step time. The parameter NAME, specifying a name for the time point sequence so that it can be referenced by output definitions (*NODE FILE, *EL FILE, *NODE PRINT or *EL PRINT) is required (maximum 80 characters).This option makes sense for nonlinear static, nonlinear dynamic, modal dynamic, heat transfer and coupled temperature-displacement calculations only. In all other procedures, this card is ignored.  <P> In each step, the local step time starts at zero. Its upper limit is given by the time period of the step. This time period is specified on the *STATIC, *DYNAMIC, *HEAT TRANSFER or *COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT keyword card. The default step time period is 1.   <P> The total time is the time accumulated until the beginning of the actual step augmented by the local step time.  <P> GENERATE is the second optional parameter. If specified, the user can define a regular pattern of time points by specifying the starting time, the end time and the time increment.   <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*TIME POINTS </LI> <LI>Enter the required parameter NAME, and the optional parameter if needed. </LI> </UL>  <P> Following line, using as many entries as needed, if GENERATE is not specified:  <UL> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> <LI>Time. </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if more than eight entries are needed.  <P> Following line, using as many entries as needed, if GENERATE is specified:  <UL> <LI>Starting time </LI> <LI>End time </LI> <LI>Time increment </LI> </UL> Repeat this line if more than one regular sequence is needed.  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*TIME POINTS,NAME=T1
.2,.3.,.8
</PRE>  <P> defines a time points sequence with name T1 consisting of times .2, .3 and .8 time units. The time used is the local step time.  <P> <PRE>
Example:

*TIME POINTS,NAME=T1,GENERATE
0.,3.,1.
</PRE>  <P> defines a time points sequence with name T1 consisting of the time points 0., 1., 2., and 3. The time used is the local step time.  <P>  <P><P> <BR> Example files: beamnlptp  <P>  </body></html>
