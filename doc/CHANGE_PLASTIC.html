Combined hardening or user-defined hardening data are not allowed.  <P> There is one optional parameter HARDENING. Default is HARDENING=ISOTROPIC, the only other value is HARDENING=KINEMATIC for kinematic hardening. All constants may be temperature dependent.   <P> For the selection of plastic output variables the reader is referred to Section 6.8.7.  <P>  <P><P> <BR>  <P> First line:  <UL> <LI>*CHANGE PLASTIC </LI> <LI>Enter the HARDENING parameter and its value, if needed </LI> </UL>  <P> Following sets of lines define the isotropic hardening curve for HARDENING=ISOTROPIC and the kinematic hardening curve for HARDENING=KINEMATIC: First line in the first set:  <UL> <LI>Von Mises stress. </LI> <LI>Equivalent plastic strain. </LI> <LI>Temperature. </LI> </UL> Use as many lines in the first set as needed to define the complete hardening curve for this temperature.  <P> Use as many sets as needed to define complete temperature dependence. Notice that it is not allowed to use more plastic strain data points or temperature data points than the amount used for the first definition of the plastic behavior for this material (in the *PLASTIC card.  <P> The raison d'&#234;tre for this card is its ability to switch from purely plastic behavior to creep behavior and vice-versa. The viscoplastic for isotropic materials in CalculiX is an overstress model, i.e. creep only occurs above the yield stress. For a lot of materials this is not realistic. It is observed in blades and vanes that at high temperatures creep occurs at stresses well below the yield stress. By using the *CHANGE PLASTIC card the yield stress can be lowered to zero in a creep (*VISCO) step following a inviscid (*STATIC) plastic deformation step.   <P> <PRE>
