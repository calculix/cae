!     extrapolates field values at the integration points to the 
!     nodes for user element i of type u1
!
!     the present routine is called for each user element of type us45;
!     the field yn(j,i) contains at entry the sum of all extrapolations
!     done for component j of the variable to node i (since a node can
!     belong to n elements (not necessarily all of type user element
!     u1) at the end n extrapolated values are available
!     for this node). They are accumulated and at the end divided by n. The
!     value of n is stored in inum(i): it starts at zero and is incremented
!     by one for each extrapolation done to node i.
!       
!     the present routine cannot be used for network elements, only for
!     structural elements
