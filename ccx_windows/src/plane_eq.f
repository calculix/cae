!     Subroutine plane_eq.f
!
!     Creates the plane equation from three known points. 
!     Gives the z-coordinate of the fourth point as an output.
!
!     x1,y1,z1: The coordinates of the first point
!     x2,y2,z2: The coordinates of the second point
!     x3,y3,z3: The coordinates of the third point
!     x0,y0: The x and y-coordinates for the fourth point
!     output: The z-coordinate according to the x0 and y0
