      subroutine linvec10(vec,konl,vecl,istart,iend,shp)
!
!     calculates a linear approximation to the quadratic interpolation
!     of the temperatures in a C3D10 element. A
!     quadratic interpolation of the temperatures leads to quadratic
!     thermal stresses, which cannot be handled by the elements 
!     displacement functions (which lead to linear stresses). Thus,
!     the temperatures are approximated by a linear function.
